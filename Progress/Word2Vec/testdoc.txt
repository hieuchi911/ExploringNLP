there are times when living under the same roof can test even the most patient among us. when favourite chairs are already taken, and food mysteriously disappears, it is no wonder that tempers start to fray – and that’s just the pets. in a rare study, researchers set out to explore the relationships between cats and dogs that shared the same homes. they found that while cats might rightly feel the more nervous of the species, they appeared to have little trouble in asserting themselves. but despite the general picture of harmony, the survey revealed cats were by far the more antagonistic of the animals. homeowners reported that cats were three times more likely to threaten their canine housemates than vice versa, and 10 times more likely to injure them in a fight. not that the dogs seemed unduly concerned: more than a fifth reportedly picked up toys to show them to cats, hall believes the reason may lie in domestication. because dogs have been domesticated for longer and are more easily trained than cats, they may be better able to control their behaviour. and with cats most often the underdog in any scrap that unfolds, the animals might understandably need more reassurance that they are safe under the same roof. it’s easier for dogs to be happier around cats than for cats to be happy around dogs, she said. after pooling information provided by homeowners, the researchers found that the best predictor for a happy cat-dog relationship was the cat’s age when it began living with the dog. one thing owners can be aware of is the age of the cat, and to make sure they get the cat at a young age, said hall, adding that under a year old may be best.
