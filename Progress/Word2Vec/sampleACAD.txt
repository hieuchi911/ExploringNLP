finds a moderate correlation between the progressive party s vote share during the period and the democratic party s vote share during the fact that progressive faction epstein also finds some evidence that the younger progressive politicians in the urban areas were likely to join the democrats while the older progressive politicians in the rural areas were likely to join the republican party the period examined in this study is slightly after the period we are interested in and does not address the issue of whether the co optation of progressive policies the democratic party electoral support to test whether the democratic party did in fact attract electoral support in areas that traditionally favored left wing third parties we conduct an analysis similar to epstein s we study the entire united states however rather than just one state we also study a much longer time period to which left third parties in the pre new deal period with the electoral support for the democratic party in the new deal and post new deal period if the decline in third party support is due to the democratic party s co optation of the left then we would expect this correlation to be both substantively and statistically significant we classified all the third parties in this period as having either left or non left orientation the left third party electoral support is then measured by aggregating the votes for these left third parties across three offices president governor and senator and then dividing this by the total vote for all candidates across the three to estimate the correlation between the left and shares during and after the new deal we estimate the following linear model where indexes counties indexes states and indexes periods the term vit stands for the average vote share shares in the pre new deal period respectively if the claim is true then we would expect to be positive and significant when vit is the post new deal average democratic vote share we ran this regression for a short period to and a longer period from to table presents the results we only present the estimates for differences between and and and and and if the democratic party attracted left third party votes we would expect the difference between and to be small we would also expect the remaining three differences we report in table to be large since the democratic party would not necessarily attract votes but may attract votes from areas that support non left third parties in both the long and short periods the difference between the coefficients on previous democratic and left third party average vote shares in the pre new deal period is relatively small and statistically insignificant in contrast the difference between the coefficients on previous non left third party and third party vote share is significantly smaller when republican vote as opposed to democratic vote is the dependent variable similarly the coefficient on previous non left third party vote share is significantly larger when republican vote as opposed to democratic vote is the dependent variable these results are all consistent with the claim that the democratic democratic and left third party vote in the nonsouth versus the south we suspect that the south was different for at least two reasons first the analysis above and historical literature suggests that electoral laws likely had more influence on third party voting in southern versus nonsouthern states second as scholars have noted the democratic party in the south did not support all thus we expect a lower correlation between pre new deal left third party voting and post new deal democratic party voting in the south as compared to the nonsouth the results in table are consistent with the claim that the democratic party was not perceived as moving as far to the left in the south as compared to when post new deal democratic vote is the dependent variable however in the south this difference is large and statistically significant only the results for the nonsouth are consistent with what we would expect if the democratic party was perceived to have moved to the left during the new deal democratic and left third party vote the new deal or some other factor we examined whether the left and or the nonleft third party vote in the period to is correlated with the average major parties vote shares during the election focusing on the election allows us to separate the effect of the democratic party s leftward shift from the general rise in support for the democratic party and roosevelt s personality it was not until the election that he and the democratic party were viewed as clear advocates of left wing economic policies if the claim that the democratic party co opted the left third parties policy position during the new deal is true then we would expect the coefficient on pre new deal left third party vote to be substantially smaller than the coefficient on pre new deal than when the democratic vote in is the dependent variable which differs from the results when the average democratic vote in the post new deal period is the dependent variable comparing roosevelt to wilson and bryan prior to the new deal the democratic party was commonly perceived to be divided between its stalwart and attempted to co opt the populist position in with the nomination of the populist presidential candidate william jennings bryan the democratic party also made a move to the left in with the nomination of woodrow wilson who was also perceived to be a progressive candidate the question we address in this section is how unique was fdr relative to bryan and the relationship between the democratic vote and the left third party vote differed between bryan wilson and fdr for each democratic candidate we examined the correlation between the average left third party vote in elections eight years prior to the candidate s presidential nomination and the average democratic vote in the elections
the eu accession it is of utmost interest to point out especially the indirect costs of the process in order not only to passively take notice of them but to be control them and minimize their potentially negative impact expected benefits associated with the eu accession there is no doubt that the expected improvement in the tourism demand structure should not be exclusively conditional upon croatia s accession into the eu however there is strong evidence that the demand structure within a tourist destination is strongly positively correlated with its image in the international in this regard the following rule of thumb the better a certain country is integrated into international economy and politics the more it is attractive not only to an increased number of tourists but to market segments of a higher propensity to spend as well this is a direct consequence of a better accessability and perception of safety which makes such a country more interesting for indivudual visitors regardless of their primary visitation motives having in mind a not so positive image of croatia in the last fifteen years despite the fact that it has improved considerably since year the mere status of a eu candidate and especially the act of eu accession itself should multifold improve the international ranking of croatia as a tourist destination apart from this one time effect the eu membership will by means of various activities initiatives policies and eu presence worldwide contribute actively to croatian image over the long run this in should translate into increased visitation especially of the more wealthy market niches as a result of the improvement of overall country image hence it is to expect that the market share of individual travellers will gradually grow whereas the allotments and groups market shares should simultaneously decline further the eu accession implies harmonization in educational and skills as well as the access to job openings and working experience in other eu member countries as a combined result of the above the total quality of service in all means of tourism establishments should gradually level with the eu standards which should in turn have additional positive impact on the tourist visitation and tourism receipts in finally a higher quality of service will additionally contribute to an increase of confidence in croatia as a tourist destination to be repeatedly visited which implicitly translates into increasing confidence and willingness to buy various croatian tourist products tourist experiences since an increase in demand for visiting croatia as well as the improvement in the demand structure both ask for a pronounced diversification in the coutry s tourism offer not only in the terms of new product but in terms of value chain creation on the level of each microdestination the tourist season should gradually extend hence it is to be expected that the tourism demand will in future be much more evenly spread throughout the year due to the legal harmonization with the eu as well as to improved efficiency of the whole administative framework on the national and local levels one can expect considerable improvements in the sphere of spatial planning space utilization and space management over the long run in view of the existing decentralized decision making and high degree of local autonomy in the investment activity coupled with the expected improvements in the spatial planning process and a higher level of transparency in the project development and investment sphere more adequate means for effective land preservation controls will be established the same should hold for project evaluation yardsticks for various private sector s initiatives all these hence guarantee the avoidance of further devastation new should in their own right contribute to the overall attractiveness of the croatian tourism offer and the country s image on the world tourism market expected costs associated with the eu accession despite the fact that most people especially over the medium and long term relate croatia s process of eu accession mostly with numerous benefits one should nevertheless be aware of a several direct and indirect costs which will not be possible and despite the fact that it is sometimes cumbersome to clearly delineate ones from the other this article as previously stated differentiates between costs which can be attributed to the legal harmonization with the eu standards from costs which will arise predominantly from increased interest of foreign private persons and legal entities to either acquire property or conduct business on croatian territory it can be said that their impact is directly associated with the eu accession in this regard one can treat them as direct costs of eu accession however it is somewhat doubtful whether their individual and or combined impact represents a cost to croatia at all namely although these costs will negatively affect the performance of the croatian tourism industry and have an unfavorable impact on the standard of living in the short to medium term these costs should be regarded as investment into the future ie as investment into the long term related quality of life on the other hand although costs related to increased foreign interest to invest in croatia represent to a certain extent indirect costs associated with the eu accession their potential negative impact could by far be more harmful for the country costs associated with harmonization to eu legislature the first assocation that comes to mind is related to increased operational costs due to new much stricter regulations in the area of consumer protection workplace safety and environmental protection higher expected operational costs are only a logical consequence of inauguration of a series of additional controls of food hygiene and quality as well as of food origin and tracebility additionally due to stricter consumer protection workplace safety and security regulations new mandatory investment related neither to increases in revenue nor to profitability improvements will be required in order to remove various safety deficiencies and bottlenecks it is therefore to expect that a number of smaller tourism sector operators especially those running family businesses will be negatively
to which parents and children in the present study parents and children in the present study coordinated or attuned their vocal behaviors to the other will be discussed in the following section bi directional influence in parent child conversation tables contain the results of chi square analysis of times series regression for each of the dyad groups as shown evidence for mutual influence or significant interpersonal accommodation was observed more frequently for cws and their and their parents in mother cws dyads the duration of both the child s and the mother s simultaneous speech influenced the duration of these vocal states in the subsequent speech of their partner no significant mutual influence was observed in the interactions between cwdns and their mothers for any of the vocal states for father cws dyads significant bi directional accommodation was seen for both pause duration and the duration of speech while in cwdns father dyads mutual influence was observed for turn switching pause durations alone cwdns on the other hand exhibited no significant mutual accommodation with their mothers and significant unidirectional cit for only two vocal states while talking with their mothers switching pauses and noninterruptive simultaneous speech further these same children and their fathers engaged in mutual influence for switching pause durations and the children cit with their fathers for interruptive simultaneous speech this observation indicates that cwdns were influenced by the duration of interruptive simultaneous speech in their father s previous turn but not vice versa overall findings suggest that while talking with their mothers and fathers cws were more likely than cwdns to coordinate with or accommodate to the temporal patterns of their periods and that children who stutter and their parents are more likely to exert mutual influence mothers as previously discussed the cws in this study and their mothers exhibited mutual influence for both forms of simultaneous speech both noninterruptive and interruptive in addition as shown in table the mothers of cws exhibited significant cit for turn durations in other words as their children increased and or decreased the duration of their turns their suit in their subsequent turns in sum in mother cws conversations temporal synchrony or coordination of the duration of vocalizations switching pauses and turns was unidirectional in that either the children or mother was influenced by the other but not vice versa finally while there was no significant mutual influence in mother cwdns dyads the mothers of these children exhibited coordinated interpersonal timing for both interruptive simultaneous speech duration fathers the fathers of both cws and cwdns were influenced by different vocal states than the mothers specifically during conversation the fathers of cws coordinated the duration of their pauses with those of their child during previous conversational turns while the fathers of cwdns coordinated the duration of their noninterruptive simultaneous speech and switching pauses degree of coordinated interpersonal timing multiple analyses of variance revealed no significant differences in the degree to which cit was achieved for the duration of different vocal states across the two groups of children and two groups of parents however when the groups of children were combined anova results indicated that a significant effect for parent type was observed for vocalization duration both groups of children regardless of whether or were normally disfluent exhibited a greater degree of cit for vocalization durations during conversations with their fathers than with their mothers personality attributes of children comparison of children who do and do not stutter personality inventory for children the family relations withdrawal and social skills scales from the pic were examined because of previouswork suggesting that these or very similar constructs are related to cit the family relations scale measures family effectiveness and cohesion with regard to such factors as communication between parents parent participation in and expectations about child rearing and general home atmosphere elevated family relations scale scores reflect increased marital instability and conflict and decreased effectiveness in disciplining children in the home the withdrawal scale measures participation in social contact elevated scores reflect a child s increased social withdrawal and isolation highly elevated scores reflect more extreme withdrawal and isolation and also indicate social discomfort the social skills scale measures success in social activities with peers elevated social skill scores reflect a child s difficulty in making and keeping friends table shows the family relations social skills and withdrawal scale scores for the children who stutter and their nonstuttering peers respectively independent samples tests revealed significant between group differences for both family relations and social skills that is as a group the children who stutter obtained significantly higher scores for both family relations and social skills scales indicating that their homes were characterized by greater marital discord as compared to those of the children who do not stutter and they had more difficulty than the the nonstuttering children in making and maintaining friendships personality attributes of parents comparison of mothers and fathers of children who do and do not stutter personality attributes questionnaire and pf tables and show the competitiveness and expressiveness raw scores and warmth and dominance standard scores for the mothers and fathers of both groups of children respectively for both the competitiveness and expressiveness the paq a higher score in either reflects an increased tendency to exhibit that personality trait for the higher scores on the warmth scale reflect an outgoing nature and tendency to be more attentive to others while elevated dominance scores reflect a forceful and assertive personality independent samples tests revealed no significant differences between the two groups of mothers or the two groups of fathers in either competitiveness expressiveness warmth or dominance relationship between child personality factors and cit as an initial attempt to examine potential relationships between personality attributes of the children is this study and cit we conducted a stepwise multiple regression analysis using social skills and withdrawal as predictor variables of the cit coefficients separate multiple regression equations were calculated for each of the five vocal state durations and for turn duration resulting in separate regression

more aggressive responses when the purpose of assessment was disclosed in either event this result although statistically significant purpose of study was to explore the necessity of indirect measurement when crts are used results indicate that compared with a control condition of participants who took the crt a under normal testing conditions disclosing the purpose of assessment impacted individuals abilities to see through the test and identify the keyed present themselves in the worst possible manner were able to readily identify the aggressive responses the effect size for this mean difference was quite large but not unexpected given recent meta analytic results that indicated that individuals tend to be quite successful at faking bad on personality inventories when instructed to do so similarly individuals who most logical solution also appeared to identify and actually endorse the aggressive responses although the effect size for this mean difference was quite small collectively these results underscore the problems associated with disclosing the purpose of the crt a basically revealing the true purpose of the crt a and instructing respondents to either identify the most logical in effect by divulging the purpose of assessment we took an indirect measure and turned it into a direct measure moreover as most direct measures have some degree of transparency the results from this study reiterate the susceptibility of such measurement systems to faking by demonstrating that scores were affected by disclosure of the purpose of assessment study offers support for the necessity item responses however this study does not test whether individuals can fake the crt a when indirect measurement is maintained study addresses this limitation by exploring whether the traditional indirect form the crt a can be faked when the purpose of the assessment is not disclosed study of instructions one set of instructions asked participants to complete the testing materials under normal testing conditions the other set of instructions asked participants to complete the materials as though they were applying for a job that they really wanted good manipulations often used in research and is more likely to be consistent with the manner in which job applicants might complete the test battery the test packets consisted of the crt a as well as self report measures of achievement motivation extroversion agreeableness conscientiousness emotional stability and aggression in general we expected higher mean scores on the self report surveys under job applicant instructions indirect nature of the crt a was maintained we expected no mean differences in crt a scores between the two sets of instructions observing mean differences in the self report surveys simply replicates previous research and thus the inclusion of the self report surveys in this study served as a manipulation check to make sure our faking manipulation was salient to the respondents stated formally our hypothesis is as follows scores obtained under normal testing instructions and those obtained by asking respondents to fake good on the crt a will not be significantly different from one another method participants a total of undergraduate students enrolled in psychology classes were invited to complete survey packets containing the crt a and self report surveys at two time points all participants received psychological association ethical guidelines similar to study we calculated a validity scale for the crt a by summing the number of illogical distractor responses endorsed under the normal test taking instructions and we removed participants with five or more illogical responses from the data analysis this resulted in participants being self report packet during one of the two administrations but did complete the crt a during both administrations thus this participant was included in the test of hypothesis but not in the manipulation check the final sample consisted of participants the majority of participants were currently employed and those who were employed worked an average of hr per two time points under two different sets of instructions in the control condition participants were informed that they were being asked to volunteer in a research study aimed at understanding how contextual factors impact the responses to psychological tests they then completed the packet containing an inductive reasoning test and self report surveys under normal conditions and instructions and because customer service jobs require dealing with the public in a friendly and helpful manner and doing so in a dedicated and detailed manner we decided to collect data using a measure of the big five personality traits we simply added the measures of achievement striving and aggression because we assumed on such jobs whereas individuals who were aggressive would perform worse on such jobs crt a the crt a was the same as that used in study the internal consistency reliabilities for the crt a all exceeded the minimum recommended faking condition self report measure of big five personality traits forty items designed to measure four of the big five personality traits were taken from the web site for the international personality item pool participants were asked to respond to each item using a point likert type scale ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree in the current study items were used from the extroversion agreeableness conscientiousness internal consistency reliabilities in the control condition were and respectively internal consistency reliabilities in the fake good condition were and respectively items measuring openness to experience were not included in the analyses because we did not expect openness to be related to respondents perceptions concerning a customer service job specifically we used nonredundant achievement striving items including items corresponding to the six factor personality questionnaire achievement striving scale items corresponding to the multidimensional personality questionnaire achievement seeking scale and items corresponding to the respond to each item using a five point likert type scale ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree the internal consistency reliabilities for this scale were and for the control condition and the fake good condition respectively self report measure of aggression self reported aggression was measured with the item scale from the jackson personality research form that ranged from strongly agree to strongly disagree the internal
in better formulating a basis from which to understand the move but also to show how writers frequently mismanage the move chronotopes of the cover letter genre and what the pedagogical and semantic implications of these generic errors might be in both academic and professional settings in addition to a description of the language used genre analysis is also an explanation of why language is used differently within specific cultures and a demarcating of this specific language into smaller elements called moves a move to swales is a text segment that consists of a package of various linguistic features such as lexicon syntax and illocutionary propositions which are responsible for providing the given segment a uniform orientation and signal the content of the discourse these moves can be inferred through context but they are mainly examined based on their linguistic clues further a move within a text can be considered any portion of that text that is either written or spoken and achieves a particular function within that text however not all elements of a text are obligatory and many elements such as certain moves can be considered optional moves are considered consequential because while the language of a genre as a whole is useful the specific language associated with the each move must also be considered if a writer is to be wholly accepted by the genre community as a heuristic device writers need to understand the premise behind each move and then decide what strategy can be used concerning the written application of that move this paper also assumes as connor precht and upton that genres have cultural expectations and when a writer moves between cultures with the same genre some relearning of the genre must take place in order to correctly negotiate the cultural differences within the same genre in this way writing for a new cultural group presupposes the need to relearn the genre within that cultural group the basic principle that underlies genre analysis then is that specific moves and structures the structure of certain genres with reference to their allowable move order move construction and linguistic features the ability to identify these key linguistic structures allows for a greater understanding of genres and further allows for this understanding to be passed on to others outside of the genre in order to assist in their understanding and eventual assimilation into the genre non native speakers of english was selected the applicants had applied to an aeronautical engineering firm and a hardware production company in the united twelve of the cover letters collected were written by while the remaining were written by writers cover letters were selected for this exploratory chronotopic analysis because of their wide use within the business community the plethora of prior research conducted on them and their relative simplicity less explored genres such as legal briefs academic writings or business compositions were avoided at this time because these genres and the past research conducted within them were not as accommodating to an initial investigation as cover letters were the intention of a cover letter is simple to obtain an interview this is done by candidates cover letters were initially examined by bhatia in his book analyzing genre language use in professional settings bhatia was able to explain the first seven moves found in a cover letter but his main concern was not to illuminate the purpose of the cover letter but rather to compare it to the structure of a sales promotion a more in depth analysis of cover letters was done later by henry and roseberry who analyzed a corpus of cover letters in order to identify the moves of cover letters the allowable move order and the strategies used to realize the moves in doing so they established obligatory and optional moves of the cover letters and then created a separate corpus for each move henry and roseberry identified eleven moves in their corpus of cover letters three of these moves were also common moves found in all business letters in his study of direct mail letters referred to as structural elements these include elements such as date lines address information salutations complimentary closes and signature information it appears that while structural elements are important to the framing of a cover letter their individual meaning is not so much dependent upon the writer s intention as much as upon their inclusion by the writer structural elements are for the most part standardized patterns rarely differ from one writer to another according to upton some structural elements are obligatory while others are optional obligatory and optional structural elements likely only affect the meaning of a cover letter when a writer neglects to include them for the purpose of this paper it is interesting to note that these structural elements are easily distinguished from other moves because of their lack of spatio temporal markers if if according to a theory of chronotopic move analysis a move is comprised of its spatio temporal markers then structural elements cannot be considered moves but rather as obligatory or voluntary structural arrangements that influence the meaning of the text and the purpose mainly through their inclusion or exclusion with this in mind this paper will not consider two of henry and roseberry s moves as moves at additionally henry and roseberry noted that in the cover letter as the emphasis changed so did the tense used they concluded however that cover letters did not seem to have any obvious linguistic markers of move boundaries their examples of tense constructions included the dependency on the past tense in stating how skills and abilities were obtained the use of simple present tense in listing relevant skills abilities and qualification and the use of in naming present jobs the research presented in this paper provides evidence that when these same temporal constructions are coalesced with their spatial equivalents a basis can be discerned for extricating move boundaries that is to say using the chronotope as a guide moves can

for each in the singular piece tf the space lf satisfies the first point of definition for a suitable proof let sf cf for recall that the decomposition in pieces of the space reflects the geometry of the polytope and is defined via the mapping the decompositions in pieces of both spaces and lf are defined via the mapping exactly in the same way and they are related accordingly to remark the arguments used in the proof of theorems and apply with no important symplectic in the case of consider for instance the singular pieces of lf each singular piece corresponds to a singular face of properly containing let be the dimension of we want to prove that the singular piece is a quasifold of dimension covered by one chart the polytope to be considered is now we can choose such that card and remark point there exists if ig such that having set bkahk the coefficient by we shall mean define the discrete groups if ig and lgf if ig in the following way the homeomorphism from the model if to lgf is induced by the continuous mapping with the proof that the mapping induces a homeomophism onto goes very similarly to that given for the mapping in the proof of theorem part i but since we deal now with the group the key result here is lemma the atlas obtained all of the charts corresponding to those i and satisfying the conditions specified above the mapping hf let be a singular face of dimension and let be a point in tf we prove that near our space is homeomorphic to the twisted product of an open subset of tf by a cone over the link lf let be such that gives a model for tf as constructed in the proof of theorem part ii in what follows we identify tf with this model the discrete i acts on the quotient and on the product i in the following way by making use of the explicit atlases it is straightforward to check that the quotient inherits the decomposition in strata of the product we want to choose now an and a invariant open subset of i such that i and the mapping hf from the twisted product to the open subset of given by the open neighborhood in tf homeomorphic to i the open subset is a submodel in tf choose now in such a way that for each we have with these choices the mapping hf is well defined continuous and injective it is easy to check via lemma that hf is surjective moreover a simple adaptation of the argument used in the proof of theorem step shows that the mapping hf is closed finally we observe that by construction the mapping mapping hf takes strata into strata and its restriction to each stratum is a diffeomorphism of quasifolds according to

subset of lgr by a cone over the link lgr in order to do so define gr in analogy with consider now the discrete groups igr and igr such that igr as in the proof of lemma we choose an open neighborhood

had had an affair with her the twist in the plot arises from what does not happen to io she is not killed in a sacrifice but is restored to imagine what it would have been like for io fully aware of her identity but unable to tell anyone who she was if she had been selected to be ritually slaughtered to fulfill juno s desire for in this light the gender of the sacrificial animal in ode on a grecian urn takes on a contextual necessity that coincides with from zeitlin s analysis of the masculine violence in keats s poem while the piety of ritual would seem furthest removed from the the first stanza and sacrificial death utterly antithetical to erotic passion the heifer victim connects the two in an associative subliminal bond of potential violence to which the feminine body is perpetually what still needs to be established is that in ode on a grecian urn keats opposed rather than supported an aesthetics based on sacrifice whatever the gender of the victims might be ceres under her rule innocent cattle do not become prey to human carnivores the opposition between the festivals of ceres and juno summarized in amores and grounds two different worlds one is the world variously known as the bucolic the idyllic and the pastoral the other based on hunting and killing is the heroic or epic world in ode on a grecian urn the former is the realm of the beautiful and the latter is under the dominion of the as a source the two scenes in ode on a grecian urn appear complementary the ready assumption has been that because they are in the same poem they are also depicted on the same greek vase despite the considerable contortions required to reconcile them with the each other if keats drew on different sources for the scenes the opposition between them comes more clearly into focus the fourth stanza is a drastic alternative to the happiness and joy of the lovers frolics the first three stanzas descends from the pastoral world of theocritus s first idyll human history has not yet reached the stage of separation between divine and mortal beings it is not yet possible to distinguish deities or mortals men or gods time will be frozen on the urn in a stasis of pure passion in drastic contrast the fourth stanza opens a rupture through which history to keats s own present with the introduction of juno epic displaces pastoral the freedom of dancing is replaced by the orders of the procession and the sacrifice unlimited happiness yields to violent desolation pastoral may seem cold when measured by the sublime energy of epic history the energy keeping the world green is gentle rather than urgent can the beautiful object resist the a relic that has avoided becoming a victim in the historical process as a still unravish d bride it has not yet shared juno s fate important in this regard are the political implications of the choice of the urn for ekphrasis unlike the shields of achilles and aeneas epic s paradigmatic objects for ekphrasis sublime in their cosmic imagery the urn has no military purpose or nor does it daphnis and apollo but there is a critical difference between the history of daphnis and that of juno daphnis will not be violated bold lover never never canst thou kiss though winning near the goal as an alternative to the sublime the urn must renounce the economy of sacrifice on which the progress of epic was founded the renunciation the sign must be annihilated so that the sign may become transcendental as a material object the urn will not be destroyed unlike the heifer at the end of the ritual the heifer all her silken flanks with garlands rest will no longer exist having been sublimated as a demonstration of fealty to the goddess by contrast the urn works as an aesthetic object preserved so that it may continue to produce its effects to the urn is a kind of energy drawing us out of ourselves constantly in the process of the urn cannot legitimate the economy of sacrifice in what and how it represents the beautiful does not result from suffering so there is no longer any need for keats to find ways to transform the pain of the sublime into the pleasure of the beautiful the urn produces meaning by converting the two ideals of truth and beauty back and forth in the dialectic makes beauty into truth truth into beauty beauty into truth and so on endlessly without sacrificing either for the other even the war between the sexes the dominant theme of the amores is no longer joined ideal love like the unheard melodies will be sweeter because it does not become part of the actual realm where lovers quarrel hurt each other and eventually die anonymous no real couple has been transformed into lifeless forms to serve the purposes of art by grounding beauty and truth reciprocally in each other keats establishes an alternative to the sublime economy the self sustaining economy of beauty as truth is based on the model of the unlimited energy of cosmic flux presented by ovid in the metamorphoses right after the denunciation of sacrifice into everything else nihil est toto quod perstet in orbo cuncta fluunt omnisque uagans formatur imago in other words the effort to grasp the world via ideal images is empty and immoral empty because both the world and the images continu ally shift immoral because matter is forcefully dominated by arbitrary forms the violent assault of forms on matter the violence of sacrifice disrupts the divine economy to produce what are supposed to be realities substantial presences but turn out to be deceptions since they exhaust the cosmic economy similarly violent deeds committed in epic struggle may produce a momentary sublime but they eventually lead to exhaustion beauty however creates an unlimited the excess
can detect a certain degree test statistically the null hypothesis stating that the directions of arrows in the network are assigned randomly and to contrast it to the alternative hypothesis stating that the degree of transitivity between the directions of arrows exceeds the chance level only if it is highly unlikely that the observed degree of partial transitivity is obtained by chance detecting changes in firing order as mentioned when neuronal activity is evoked by different stimulation conditions neurons can change their order of firing to detect such changes within large networks one needs a statistical test to investigate whether the phase offsets are obtained from networks with identical firing sequences be different akin to the commonly used non parametric tests such as the sign test or wilcoxon signed ranks test a non parametric test for changes in the firing order can be created by applying the present test of partial transitivity to a difference network if the network obtained under one stimulation condition is the reference and the one under the other condition is the target in the target from the corresponding magnitude of the delay in the reference network si note that the order of indexes needs to be matched because sqp hence if and represent matrices of delays in the reference and the target networks respectively the difference matrix is computed as the difference networks have the following interesting the networks will also be perfectly additive thus if the target and the reference networks originate from different firing sequences of the units the difference network should contain additive structural changes in the delays in contrast if the target and the reference originate from the same firing sequences the values in the difference network will result solely from the random variations in the in a random assignment of the directions of delays and thus in a lack of additivity the partial transitivity within the difference network should also not exceed the chance level therefore the previously postulated transitivity test can be also applied to difference networks to investigate whether these networks indicate transitive changes in the of random variations of the measurement errors it is important to note that transitivity of the difference network does not imply transitivity of the original networks two non transitive networks can produce a transitive difference therefore whenever investigating the transitivity of difference networks it is desirable to determine also the transitivity of the original networks are required first one needs to define an appropriate measure of the degree to which a particular network is partially transitive second probabilities need to be computed for obtaining the given degree of partial transitivity by chance measure of partial transitivity the measure of partial transitivity proposed here is based on the transitivity of sub networks larger than triples is investigated indirectly because as the proof in appendix shows if all of the triples of a given network are transitive then the entire network is also transitive thus the present measure assumes that the larger the number of transitive triples the larger the degree of partial transitivity the actual measure that is used here is expressed this number is always much smaller than the number of transitive triples and is thus easier to handle therefore for a network of nodes all the triples are tested and the count of the non transitive ones is used as an indicator of the degree to which the network is partially transitive provided for the probabilities that fully connected networks with zero and with one non transitive triple will arise by chance as these calculations were too complex for larger numbers of triples the remaining probabilities were obtained by simulations thus up to random networks were generated with sizes of up to nodes where the direction of each was then counted in every network and these counts were subsequently used to compute the probability distributions for observing a certain number of nontransitive triples in a random network of a given size the results are shown in fig for network sizes of up to nodes note the saw shaped distributions indicating that an even number of non transitive triples is slightly more likely non transitive triples that satisfies a certain criterion of statistical significance to this end the probability distributions were integrated into cumulative distributions and the critical counts of non transitive triples were determined at the left tails of the cumulative distributions the resulting counts from these results one can see that the critical number of nontransitive triples depends strongly on the network size for example transitivity within a network of nodes is significant at an alpha level of only if the network does not contain a single non transitive triple in contrast a network of nodes can contain up to non transitive triples as made applying the test to a sample dataset the present test was applied also to a sample dataset of nine units and six stimulation conditions obtained from the cat visual cortex this dataset was acquired by using similar methods to those reported previously in schneider and nikoli and in schneider et al the original cchs computed obtained after fitting gabor functions are shown in fig visual inspection of the networks in fig suggests both additivity of phase offsets and a change in the temporal structure across the stimulation conditions thus the present non parametric method was applied to investigate whether the partial transitivity of phase offsets in these networks exceeds the chance level their differences networks exceeds the chance level a network of nodes consists of triples and for the alpha levels of and the critical counts of non transitive triples are and respectively table shows the resulting counts of the non transitive triples in three stimulation conditions the count of non transitive triples was zero indicating that the non transitive triples did not exceed two thus the networks showed highly significant levels of partial transitivity in all six stimulation conditions indicating that the structures of the networks were highly additive these results are consistent with
from his long sleep and exerted himself and the day began a new avatar the brahman had never thought to be a brother of mankind as well as a child of thoreau where he says to use an obsolete latin word i might say ex oriente lux ex occidente frux from the east light from the west nevertheless thoreau could use strands of asian involvement such as the outward confucian ethic sufi egalitarianism and the ta paradigm of detached selfless action in walking a clear sense of this thrust from asia and america is present in his argument that to all the laws both of heaven and earth by virtue of his relation to the law maker that is active duty says the vishnu purana which is not for our bondage that is knowledge which is for our liberation all other duty is good only unto weariness all other knowledge is only the cleverness of an artist struggles at the end of the in came thoreau s walden and his lecture slavery in massachusetts followed by his involvement in the growing controversy over slavery in massachusetts and his strong personal support for the abolitionist activist john brown over the next few years here emerson s obituary comment on thoreau comes to mind so much knowledge of nature s secret and genius few others possessed none in a more large and religious stevenson considered that at walden thoreau had chosen to devote himself to oriental philosophers the study of nature and the work of self improvement meanwhile burroughs thought thoreau was probably the wildest civilized man this country has produced adding to the the hermit and woodsman the wildness of the poet and to the wildness of the poet the greater ferity and elusiveness of the thoreau himself had associated such strands as in his journal entry in that the fact is i am a mystic a transcendentalist and a natural philosopher to in such a vein of deep ecology thoreau could hold in a week that men nowhere elm willingly shadows man would desecrate it by his touch and so the beauty of the world remains veiled to him he needs not only to be spiritualized but naturalized on the soil of thoreau s sensitivity to nature could take him into the pre christian west of greek mythology where the great god pan is not dead perhaps of all the gods of new england and of ancient greece i am most constant at his shrine yet it could also take him east to india nothing is more gentle than nature this was why christy sawhowa common denominator of all that thoreau took from the hindus chinese and persians was a mystical love for whereas emerson s essay nature was still something of an external view thoreau s more personal exploration in a week and walden was an internal view living in and by nature in the midst of a range of supportive asian ideas and methods thoreau was that the oriental books were his daily bread at concord thoreau s use of oriental wisdom went beyond book admittedly thoreau was often dependent on translations of oriental texts made by european scholars however in walden thoreau was also ultimately skeptical should one be confined to books no matter how well selected compared with the discipline of looking always at what is to be seen will you be a reader a student merely or a seer read your fate see what is before you and walk on into futurity a futurity that in a week had earlier been described as the tempting but unexplored pacific ocean of futurity pointing to asian at walden he had indeed explored and walked along such asian paths thoreau s vision here overlaps with much of classical asian spirituality vis a they truly are to observe the still quiet moment as such this vision points forward to thoreau s subsequent adoption by western zen asian texts were themselves secondary where in thoreau s eyes the vedas and their angas are not so ancient as serene within the indian setting though there was plenty of emphasis on primary despite his use of oriental literature had not fully understood the philosophy of india which was centered for thoreau on contemplation the genius of those indeed he considered that western philosophers have not conceived of the significance of contemplation in their ie india s senses with reference to the spiritual discipline to which the brahmans subjected themselves and the wonderful power of abstraction to which his walden sojourn he could say i realized what the orientals mean by this view of asian wisdom was then ultimately an intensely if still practical spiritual vision it was in the light of his walden experiences and reflections that thoreau recognized walt whitman s emerging poetry as being wonderfully like the as west went east in the form of the forcible american opening up of japan to trade by the perry mission to japan in thoreau criticized this commercial imperialism the whole enterprise of this nation which is not an upward but a westward one toward oregon california japan etc is totally devoid of interest to me they may go to their manifest destiny which i trust is not mine what end do they propose to themselves beyond as west in the form of chinese workers along the pacific coast thoreau in the last year of his life could lament in life without principle the american materialistic profit drives manifested during the the gold rush to california is this the ground on which orientals and occidentals meet a grain of gold will gild a great surface but not so much a grain of wisdom thoreau s own ground of encounter had been a very where the inward dimension and a focus on the practical exploration of oriental wisdom was ex oriente lux for a very yankee sort of oriental here though a final further shift in thoreau s horizon can be suggested in america categorizations distinguishing between perceived polarities of west and east can be seen in thoreau
as blue shifted sag does not afford much flexibility since the epitaxial architecture is fixed in all components the soa and photodetector are forced to employ the same high confinement mqw structure as used in the laser resulting in low saturation power in both receiver components since sag exploits the contrast in surface kinetics of the growth constituents on the semiconductor and dielectric a high degree of calibration optimization must be an established and simple integration platform is based on the use of offset qws where the mqw active region is grown above a passive bulk wave guide the mqwis selectively etched in regions where gain is not required leaving the nonabsorbing waveguide as shown in fig although this process only requires a single blanket type regrowth it allows for only two band edges on a single chip the modal gain in the offset qw is offset from the mqw this scheme forces the use of bulk franz keldysh type eams which are not as efficient as qw eams utilizing the qcse in the dual qw platform as shown in fig an mqw is grown in the center of the bulk waveguide below the offset mqw such that a second qw band edge is defined on the single chip the dual platform does not provide additionally this scheme imposes a passive loss versus efficiency tradeoff the efficiency will increase as the waveguide mqw bandgap energy is decreased however this will also increase the passive loss since the waveguide wells are present throughout the device to manage this tradeoff longer eam lengths are used at the expense of bandwidth in the dual qw and offset qw either the mqw or the waveguide material as the absorber the relatively high confinement factor in the active mqw will result in low soa saturation power the high confinement factor structure is not an optimal architecture for high power high speed photodiodes in the asymmetric twin waveguide integration scheme selective removal of the upper active waveguide such that only the lower passive waveguide remains in regions where active functions are not required the optical power is coupled between the even and odd modes supported by the waveguide using carefully designed taper couplers this technique eliminates the need for regrowth only in applications where vertical current injection is wavelength agile pics although this platform can enable multiple functions on a single chip the nature of the vertical coupling into different epitaxial layers would create great difficulty when defining additional active component architectures beyond the two found in the laser modulator transmitters or the soa photodetector receivers devices reported in that is the atg platform does not appear fit for gain low confinement mqw active regions for high saturation power a high confinement blue shifted mqw for high efficiency eams and high saturation current photodetector structures such as the utc quantum well intermixing as shown in fig allows for the strategic post growth tuning of multiple qw band edges without introducing difficult growth steps or discontinuities a number of techniques that have evolved over the years to accomplish selective intermixing such as impurity induced disordering impurity free vacancy enhanced disordering photoabsorption induced disordering and implantation enhanced interdiffusion qwi enables the use of a mqw active region for maximized modal gain in lasers and blue shifted qws in the eams and offered by bjr and sag since multiple qw band edges can be defined on a single chip the passive and eam band edges can be independently optimized to avoid the passive loss versus efficiency tradeoff of the dual platform qwi does not change the average composition of the mqw such that there is a negligible index discontinuity at the interface between adjacent sections this eliminates parasitic here we employ a high flexibility integration method combining an impurity free implant enhanced qwi technique with simple blanket mocvd regrowth the qwi process uses a single implant to introduce point defects in an undoped inp buffer layer grown above the qws thermal propagation steps are used to diffuse the point defects through the desired band edge has been achieved this process allows for the realization of any number of band edges on a single chip as the number is determined only by the number of times the thermal processing is interrupted such that the buffer layer can be selectively removed in specified regions in fig the characteristic band edge shift versus anneal time is shown for implanted the process along with an overview of the pics fabricated using this technique can be found in although qwi provides a simple method to achieve multiple band edges on a single chip for high performance lasers and eams alone it does not provide the capability to integrate optimal architectures for high saturation power soas and specialized photodetectors by combining blanket mocvd regrowth state of the art lasers modulators soas and photodetectors on a single chip without bjr or sag the pic designer is not only free to control the band edge in the growth plane but now has the flexibility to control the band edge in the direction normal to the growth plane and to define unique architectures in the soas and photodetectors first qwi is used to define three unique bandgaps next simple blanket regrowth and wet etch steps are carried out to define a low confinement offset mqw for use in soas and utc photodiode structures a side view schematic of a single chip possessing the four state of the art architectures is shown in fig the key attribute of this high flexibility scheme is that it as does the butt joint method the slight discontinuities created in this scheme reside above the intermixed waveguide core such that only the tail of the propagating mode encounters them furthermore our process requires no complicating dielectric patterns to remain on the semiconductor surface to prevent deposition during growth as in the bjr or sag methods the widely tunable transmitters demonstrate over nm of tuning with db optical bandwidths up to ghz and
about the structure and the linearization procedure i have expanded a to include a and the root in these statements as noted general definitions concerning headedness and so on could be invoked in justifying specific outputs eg the head initial should determine as opposed to and so all other things being equal it is assumed that these statements are additive ie they are statements added to the representation in addition to the set of statements that define the hierarchical properties of this phrase marker as noted above in addition to what appears in there must be additional statements for the subparts of words the subwords the statements above define the ordering of the second step associated with imposes in the way described above continuing with the example based on this additional set of statements is as follows with string adjacency at the word level established by the statements in the rule for synthetic comparative formation is stated in terms of as in this rule replaces the initial formulation of local dislocation formulated in above which was stated in terms of is that all local dislocation operations are defined in terms of statements derived by the normal linearization mechanisms in particular in terms of concatenation statements like see embick for some discussion for the derivation of prouder than john there is a statement in the last line of that meets the environment for the effects of the application of are shown the rule transforms the ordering statement deg cmpr on the left hand side into the representation on the right where deg is a subword affixed to a a final question concerns the statement that is the output of the local dislocation rule and how it relates to other concatenation statements the complex head after the local dislocation ie the comparative adjective deg cmpr has to appear specify an ordering on the adjective prior to the application of the same relative ordering between proud a and proud must be maintained after deg has been affixed as a subword to the adjective one way to accomplish this is with reference to what the statements in contain in the first place while in the subword components of individual words are represented the rule that introduces is defined at the word level ie other words directly not by virtue of their subparts the internal structure of the words is irrelevant to these ordering statements as long as the individual words can be distinguished from one another no crucial reference to their internal structure must be made in the statements derived by the upshot of this is that the adjective has the same linearization status after affixation of deg as it does before that is when local dislocation object inherits or retains the linearization contraints imposed on perhaps it has the requirements of as well although this is only one the rules above account for synthetic formation in the case of normal comparatives in the case of metalinguistic comparatives there are two observations to be made first concerning linearization statements like those defined in terms of the adjective so that is not triggered recall the structure for john is more lazy than stupid repeated from above given the rules above the linearization procedure applied to this structure does not generate the linearization statement in assuming that degp is linearized to the left of ep just like it is with normal aps deg cmpr alazy only is generated in the absence of the local dislocation rule does not apply and cmpr is supported by mo just as it is in other cases in which it is not affected by local dislocation this first explanation relies on the idea that null elements like are counted in concatenation statements in the case at hand there is potentially a second reason for the absence of synthetic metalinguistic comparatives assuming that linearization and occur in phases and that ep is a phase deg is supported by mo at a stage in the derivation before it comes to be linearly adjacent to an adjective on the assumption that ep in is adverbial adjectival the idea behind cyclic spell out is that the phonology of deg has been taken care of inside of ep before deg comes to be in any sort of relationship with the ap containing lazy inside of ep the rules for analytic forms apply since there adjective is not present at this derivational stage such that more most surfaces this account of why synthetic comparative formation does not occur requires specific assumptions about how phases are defined in terms of category defining projections and in addition some assumptions about how adverbial like modifiers fit into this system that is different theories of phases make different predictions about when the degp should have been processed and these differences are of course this analysis distinguishing between the two explanations advanced above might be possible when other case studies are examined but i will not attempt to make such a distinction here to summarize when the structural properties of metalinguistic comparatives are examined closely the absence of synthetic comparative forms can be explained in this particular case there are in fact two coherent explanations for why the local each of which leads to further questions to be investigated empirically the solutions are stated in terms of explicit assumptions about how linear order is imposed on syntactic structures a number of additional questions concern how these linearization operations are interleaved with other operations particularly given further assumptions currently under discussion in the literature eg the idea that the construction of pf proceeds in parallel to much more could be said about movement and the status of unpronounced copies in such a system some questions of this type are studied in fox and pesetsky the adverb adjective cases the metalinguistic comparatives discussed above are an instance of potential surface adjacency without the formation of a synthetic form as demonstrated above this is not a problem for a view based on structure and adjacency like the one i
insiders in period over all firm quarters is sold this implies that a at the filing is associated with an increase of in the value of stock purchased by insiders thus the associations documented in table while highly significant in a statistical sense are less significant from an economic standpoint that insiders might not learn earnings precisely until shortly before the earnings announcement so that insiders are not informed about earnings until the latter part of period in contrast at the start of period insiders likely know how the earnings figure was achieved although this information may not be publicly revealed until the filing date hence insiders may know at the beginning of period whether there is likely some further reaction by investors around the to address this concern we reperform the analysis in specifications and of table after shortening the periods over which we examine trades from days to days the results reported in table are qualitatively unchanged when we focus on just the days before and the days after the announcement window also in table the coefficient estimates on the prior retp and ln mv are and zaman the coefficient estimate on bm is positive in panel a where the dependent variable is freqp in contrast in panel wherever the coefficient estimate is significantly different from zero it is negative so the value of insider net purchases decreases in the book to market ratio we note that rozeff and zaman s evidence is based on the proportion of trades that are purchases not on the value of trades market adjusted returns are replaced with raw returns in this and subsequent regressions the positive coefficient on aret fd in period is not a result of insiders trading on the post earnings announcement drift because the coefficient on aret fd is unaffected by the inclusion of the earnings surprise in the immediately preceding earnings announcement defined as the seasonal difference in earnings per share scaled by stock price at the end of fiscal quarter relative to quarter to alleviate the concern of cross sectional dependence of insider trades we also run a fama macbeth regression of specification of table by calendar year and draw similar inferences additional tests the generally insignificant relationships in period between insider trades and the earnings announcement documented in table may be due in part to the paucity of insider period as compared to trades in periods and across firm quarters the mean values of total insider trades in periods and are and respectively one cause of the lower frequency and value of trades in period may be the higher jeopardy that attaches to trades in this period however another explanation for fewer insider trades in period may be that all traders avoid trade in period to rule out alternative explanations for the relatively low amount of insider trades in period we consider reasons why particular groups of traders may avoid trade in period and trace out the implications applying the logic in foster and viswanathan s model of variation in interday trading volume chae suggests that uninformed traders avoid the period before the earnings announcement because informed traders who have advance knowledge of the announcement seek to profit from their private information at the expense of uninformed traders anticipating a decrease in uninformed trade market makers widen the bid ask spread and the sensitivity of price to order flow increases so trading costs are higher despite the heightened price sensitivity which is caused by the anticipation of informed trades informed traders nevertheless can profit from their private information about earnings by trading are announced at the expense of uninformed traders who do not have discretion over the timing of their trades thus if insiders were informed we might expect insiders to trade more intensely before the earnings are released than afterwards this is because some of the insiders information is dissipated by the earnings announcement on the other hand if insiders were liquidity reasons they might choose to trade after the earnings announcement when trading costs are lower for the same reasons and in the same proportion as traders in general in this case we might expect to see fewer insider trades in period and more insider trades in period but in proportion to total trading volume in periods and respectively park et al who study insider trades drawn from and document a significant decrease in days prior to an annual earnings announcements relative to the preceding days to summarize we see no reason for insider trading to be disproportionately greater in period than in period for periods and the mean values of insider trades in the firm quarter period as a fraction of all trade in that firmquarter period are respectively thus the fraction of trade that is due to insiders in period is more than period the fraction of trade that is due to insiders in period is almost four times the fraction in period these results are more consistent with the jeopardy hypothesis than the alternative explanations described above we use aret fd as a proxy for the private information contained in the sec filing that insiders use for their stock trades in period however formal models preempt part of the information content of forthcoming news releases empirical evidence is consistent with this prediction preemption by reducing the magnitude of abnormal return at the release weakens the associations we seek to document despite this we document a highly significant correlation between trade in period and the abnormal return at the filing the association between insider trades and aret fd in period we rerun the regression specification of table on the subset of observations that excludes firm quarters for which the trade disclosure date is after the filing date for more than half of the trades in the quarter and the complementary subset of observations that excludes firm quarters for which the trade disclosure date is before the filing date for more than half of the trades in the quarter in the period
concludes by discussing how these new approaches help widen the ideational research agenda and broaden our understanding of the fund research the how much problem the how much problem raises the issue of how researchers can isolate the causal effect of ideas on political outcomes and assign it causal weight existing studies generally rely solely on qualitative research designs to deal with this problem usually employing process tracing in conjunction with case comparison using the method of difference these research designs can produce matter indeed as parsons claims given solid evidence of differing preferences and careful verification that they actors face identical objective constraints this control for objective causes is as free from bias as qualitative observations can be however there are two weaknesses with these research designs ideas at the expense of efficient estimates of their effect although ensuring that actors face identical objective constraints may minimize the likelihood of a biased inference this strategy fails to consider that such an approach may introduce inefficiency this inefficiency is potentially introduced from the inclusion of irrelevant control variables that is factors related to ideas but not the outcome or related to the outcome but not ideas by limiting a study to the of cases that match on a large list of control variables researchers will generally have fewer observations to use in their analysis than if a shorter list was used yet existing methodological guidance implies that a large list is preferable because it minimizes the possibility of omitted variable bias however the small number of observations that results will lead to greater inefficiency in the estimate of the effect of ideas and thus less certainty about the can be made from that study as noted there is sometimes a trade off between bias and efficiency ideally researchers would like their estimates to have both properties but this might not always be possible both qualitative and quantitative researchers are often forced to choose between an estimate that is unbiased but less efficient and one that is to some extent biased but more efficient unfortunately it is not clear how one would perform such an evaluation using qualitative methods qualitative researchers should therefore exercise caution in deciding which objective conditions variables to control for and should not over emphasize the need for unbiased estimates at the expense of efficiency greater recognition of this issue and more care in crafting research designs can thus partially is to consider supplementing qualitative research designs with quantitative methods in general quantitative methods offer researchers facing the how much problem two benefits that offset the weaknesses that arise from relying solely on qualitative research designs as suggested one benefit is that these methods provide a formal assessment of the bias efficiency trade off through an estimate of the mse this statistic enables researchers to assess formally the bias and efficiency gains across various model specifications quantitative methods also offer the additional benefit of providing formal estimates of how much ideas matter relative to other factors via the parameter estimates by controlling in the model specification for variables opposing theories suggest and specifying the effect ideas exert on outcomes quantitative methods can serve as a powerful tool for overcoming the objections of are amenable to quantitative analysis while quantitative analysis is suited for dealing with the bias efficiency trade off and the how much problem it is not as valuable for tracing the processes of ideational diffusion and compliance ideational research thus provides an excellent opportunity for new multimethod research as it raises issues that are more fruitfully analyzed by both qualitative and quantitative methods by contrast designs either qualitative or quantitative fare less likely to provide adequate answers to these issues the how to problem the how to problem is simply the issue of crafting measurements of ideas in general ideational researchers have followed two different approaches one approach focuses on behavioral outcomes that is whether an actor s behavior complies with a set of ideas another approach focuses on what actors say codify record etc to justify defend or promote their actions the most productive attempts to develop a quantitative indicator thus far use some version of content analysis although effective in some instances a serious obstacle to relying on analysis is the problem of developing and identifying cross nationally equivalent indicators and texts for analysis another new approach to develop a quantitative indicator of ideas i focus on the individual level of analysis there are good ontological reasons for focusing on this level of analysis as there the rich multidisciplinary research on professional training provides a useful set of insights for developing a quantitative indicator of ideas across a range of professions this literature highlights how professional training can exert a significant influence on an individual s views about what may be considered appropriate content of an individual s professional training can shape an individual s preferences by promoting both implicitly and explicitly a particular set of causal beliefs and normative positions as finnemore and sikkink note professional training does more than simply transfer technical knowledge it actively socializes people to value certain things above a proxy for the ideas instilled in these individuals as a result of their professional training the working assumption being that professional training in particular organizations with the empirically documented ideational commitments will likely lead actors trained there to adopt similar ideas these individuals then act as carriers of these ideas bureaus of a nation s military share similar beliefs values or culture during a given time frame then it seems reasonable to presume that any individual emerging from these organizations training during that time frame a new ph or a new soldier will also likely share those views the key to developing a quantitative indicator of ideas then is to identify the critical individuals that are being inculcated with the ideas of interest and which once the key individuals and organizations are identified the researcher can then produce scores for the cases being analyzed these scores could be nominal ordinal or continuous there are no a
weak infrastructure and adverse disease environment communications and transportation more likely because poverty meant poor hygiene and sanitation most famine victims succumbed to infectious disease rather than famine proper the deadliness of any given famine depended mainly on the severity of a harvest shortfall private philanthropy and public action might mitigate but rarely overcame the ensuing niger focus of global media attention in is probably the poorest economy in the world while gdp per head in ethiopia and malawi also threatened by famine in the new millennium are in real terms less than half that of the united states two centuries ago five of the six countries most prone to food emergencies since the mid angola in the mid the sixth sudan was ranked moreover famines within countries are most severe and slowest to disappear in remoter densely populated and poorly diversified rural in ireland in the the correlation across administrative units between population loss and measures of prefamine backwardness such as housing population density were also highly in this context the extreme backwardness of china on the eve of the great leap forward famine bears noting in chinese gdp per head was less than that of any african country in with the exception of the democratic republic of the one fourth that of gdp per capita in poverty also helps explain why infectious disease still looms large in famine mortality in sub saharan africa today it makes the cost of medical care prohibitive more d s main remaining famine prone region infectious and parasitic diseases alone were responsible for nearly half of all deaths in the with diarrheal diseases accounting for nearly one quarter of those in such areas diseases endemic in normal times still account for much of the excess compounds the anachronistic character of present day famine much of sub saharan africa has yet to experience fully the epidemiological transition public health lags rather than leads medical science this is no longer because of ignorance of low cost primary health care such as immunization prophylactics and rehydration or even because of abroad to most effective use northwest england in the anhui and sichuan in china in the northwest finland in the north hamyong province in north korea in the using population data and mortality estimates in arup maharatna the associated elasticity is a combination of the two on the harvest although as will be shown in the following sections dramatic crop failures are neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for famine even the man made famines in the soviet union in and in china in were due in part to crop failures a single year of drought and that is not enough to cause famine historically the worst famines have been the product of back to back shortfalls of the staple crop ireland offers a well known example had phytophthera infestans not struck the potato crop twice in a row in and there might have been no great irish famine deccan famine of the finnish and scottish famines of the late the berar famines of the the soviet famine of and the chinese famine of thus the probability of back toback poor harvests should provide some sense of the likelihood of famine in the past this suggests the strategy of identifying a shortfall and the likelihood of a back to back shortfall if such events were random the expected and actual incidence of repeat failures can then be compared back to back events could spring from natural or unnatural causes the former would include the effect of serial war how common were back to back poor harvests in the past agricultural output data offer some insight although such data are also scarce before the nineteenth century the renowned estate accounts of the medieval bishopric of winchester in southern england provide one straw in the wind on the assumption that yield ratios fifteen in and in both were due to excessive rains and flooding crop output data are preferable to crop yield data since the latter fail to take account of the likely impact of low yields on acreage sown in the following year table reports the outcome as those with shortfalls of over ten or twenty percent the results suggest that such back to back events are rare although more likely than might be expected on a random basis since the underlying patterns are unlikely to change much over time the results may be interpreted as tentative evidence that famines were less common in made it impossible to sustain population since most harvest shortfalls are caused by extreme weather meteorological evidence is also worth considering monthly mean temperature data are available for central england since temperature was subject to serial correlation running the annual average annual averages and when the focus is switched from average temperature to the coldest and the warmest months of each year the autocorrelation disappears for the mean minimum temperature the coefficient on the lagged term is for the mean maximum temperature the coefficient is moreover the ee degree polynomial and defining bad years as those deviating by more than ten percent from expected values gives the following probabilities and actual frequencies of back to back bad years of extreme cold or heat low high expected a similar story the frequencies of drought and flood years between and in both india as a whole and in the northwestern state of rajasthan are described in table along with the number of back toback extreme events in general all the and mitchell in in the wake of the black death corn seems to have been plentiful despite the low yields table extreme droughts and floods in india these two episodes might well be considered part of a single prolonged crisis the were a decade of hardship and famine in much of northwestern europe in and famines however in nineteenth century india and ireland for example concerns about moral hazard constrained famine relief and increased mortality wars have exacerbated famine throughout history to take a
they are in any sense sufficient certainly the historical record looks to be consistent with a contrary view it is the more affluent societies that have tended to establish well ordered liberal regimes it is the poorer societies that tend to be riven with conflict and governed by inadequate or corrupt regimes good order may secure affluence and it may provide some of the conditions necessary for ratcheting it up but that observation it being the case that at each stage in the historical process some prior accumulation of capital provides the support for the institutional consolidation so if wealth does not cause good institutions this does not mean that good institutions cause wealth to maintain either of these rarefied theses in abstraction from the other would i suggest be rather absurd so to say resources are not sufficient for wealth good order and justice is not ends nor is it to imply that some other variable such as good institutions could be sufficient however risse has a further objection against taking justice to require redistributive transfers of resources internationally which would apply even if we merely assume resources are insufficient not unnecessary for wealth the basis for a redistributive duty that pogge especially highlights is the uncompensated exclusion from use of natural resources in the use of a single natural resource base from whose benefits the worse off are largely and without compensation risse points out that an argument for redistribution based on this consideration presupposes a commitment to an egalitarian right to natural resources he then notes that this commitment gains its plausibility from the idea that there is a heap of natural resources to which each human being has an equal he draws attention to two salient points first strictly speaking raw materials become resources and thus obtain market value in virtue of their usefulness for human activities only through activities that require a social context crude oil say became important only after the invention of the motor engine second unlike biblical manna resources require work to become available oil must be extracted and refined minerals must be mined etc these two features capture to resources and while they may not entail much they do entail that it is not the case that any two individuals are equally situated with regard to all these are points i too have highlighted in a previous i fully accept with risse that materials become resources through being developed in activities that require social contexts contexts in which not all human beings participate equally however i think he is rather swift in concluding that we cannot think of the claims to them as being egalitarian in noticing the justification of inequalities in favor of those who valorize natural resources risse notices only half the story resources are made available or to put the point in other terms as i have proposed the aggregate available ecological space can be marginally increased through socioeconomic practices but resources or amounts of ecological space can also be made unavailable a key point is that there is a significant difference between generating inequalities by adding value to one s just portion of ecological space and annexing more than one s just portion of ecological space the normative logic of risse s position is that the world s bounty is up for grabs by whoever has the skill and industriousness to make use of it without any accompanying constraint of leaving enough and as good for others such even on a libertarian conception of justice i therefore do not think risse can sustain his charge against pogge that there is no case of justice to rectify a distribution of resources which leaves swathes of humanity without adequate access to them at this point i would turn to pogge however to propose that there is a stronger case for applying distributive justice to natural resources than he seeks to a friendly amendment framing the issue as one of ecological debt from an ecological perspective the affluent can be regarded as having a debt toward the global poor the world has finite resources for everyone to utilize resources at the rate the affluent currently do would require two or three additional planet earths there is only one planet earth the situation is therefore that some are drawing resources at a rate that effectively deprives others of the opportunity to draw resources even at a rate sufficient to meet their basic human needs such inequalities of opportunities for resource use can be condemned as unjust without recourse to fully fledged egalitarianism even if their rectification would look strongly most liberal standards the situation then is indeed much as pogge characterizes it the better off enjoy significant advantages in the use of a single natural resource base from whose benefits the worse off are largely and without compensation the significant advantages enjoyed by the better off correspond to disadvantages of the worse off this is not a completely zero sum game since increases of ecological productivity are possible but it is near enough to one for to recognize that in very significant measure the benefits enjoyed by the affluent are achieved at the expense of the poor having to forego benefits to the extent that this is the case then drawing of benefits by the affluent is itself unjust these benefits are drawn by using greater amounts of ecological space than the affluent have any justification for using the fact of benefiting is what is causing the harm the deprivation that should be ended it is not that we should the affluent doing a harm and then incidentally benefiting from it it is rather that in the process of drawing benefits the affluent are doing the harm pogge says that in benefiting the affluent are not necessarily doing wrong providing they compensate yet the appropriate compensation would be precisely to reduce the amount they benefit that excess benefit is unjust pogge says that the affluent should not be condemned and i
significant associations between viagra and or cialis use and the occurrence of naion however for patients with a history of myocardial infarction we did observe a strong and increased risk of naion a similar association was also observed for patients with a history of hypertension but it was of borderline statistical significance these results must be interpreted in light of several potential limitations the most apparent of which is the study s small sample size this provided limited statistical power to detect associations that were small and moderate in magnitude and yielded statistically significant association and another of borderline significance both associations suggest modest to strong associations yet despite the magnitude of these associations the lack of precision associated with these estimates provides little evidence regarding the true strength of the association should it truly exist not all of the eligible cases or controls opted to participate with respect to age or race between those who did and did not choose to participate and we have little reason to suspect selection bias with respect to the primary risk factor of interest information on viagra and cialis was obtained via telephone interview given recent media attention regarding a possible link between viagra and this issue reached the mainstream media therefore we do not believe bias explains the observed results we also have no reason to believe that any bias associated with failure to accurately recall or report the use of viagra or cialis is differential many of the existing case reports and series regarding viagra or cialis and naion have been able to isolate the exact timing of use relative to the onset of naion with this degree of precision difficult however when defining the primary exposure variable that is viagra and or cialis use we were able to define as exposed only those subjects who reported using viagra and or cialis before naion diagnosis this allowed us to minimise misclassification by limiting the definition of exposed to aetiologically relevant medication wherein such issues of temporality would be more easily addressed this is the first study to investigate the association between viagra and cialis and naion therefore placing the results in context is difficult the only evidence regarding this relation is in the form of case reports and series that by their nature do not explicitly test whether such an association might exist cases of naion that occurred shortly after viagra of interest is the fact that eight of these patients had a history of hypertension and six had history of elevated lipids only two had a history of coronary artery disease or myocardial infarction this provides support albeit indirect that should an association exist between viagra and naion it may be vascular insufficiency at the optic nerve head this insufficiency and the resulting ischaemia may be more frequent in those with certain anatomical characteristics viagra and cialis may cause damage to the optic nerve head via its ability to increase nitric oxide levels that in turn cause reduced perfusion however this does not insight regarding this issue can be gleaned from the fact that certain chronic medical conditions such as hypertension diabetes heart disease are thought to be risk factors for optic nerve head vascular therefore individuals with these conditions or specifically the pharmacological treatments for these conditions who may already be at increased risk of naion may have their issued a statement regarding reports of patients experiencing a sudden loss of vision attributed to naion after taking viagra cialis and this statement is clear that no link has been established between these medications and the occurrence of naion however it advises patients to stop taking these medicines and call a doctor or healthcare provider right away taking these products should inform their health care professionals if they have ever had severe loss of vision which might reflect a prior episode of naion such patients are at an increased risk of developing naion again similarly recent publications have suggested that ophthalmologists ask all men with naion about the use of sildenafil and that patients given the results of the current study patients with a history of myocardial infarction or hypertension who are prescribed viagra or cialis should be warned about the elevated risk of naion associated with the use of these medications though naion is a rare condition the large number of men using viagra or cialis suggests that should an association truly exist the incidence of naion could rise dramatically for laser beam propagation on km urbanized path an experiment of laser propagation was carried out

presaged more of the same was unclear although nothing was said about in coker a type worry about the historically disproportionate use of the death penalty to punish black men for raping white women almost certainly motivated the court s moreover there are important strains of type review in the decision justice white s plurality opinion and especially justice powell s concurring opinion contain passages suggesting that it was only because coker s victim death was disproportionate the constitutionality of the death penalty for aggravated rape of a child was left coker was an easy case for another reason given how infrequent capricious and racially skewed death sentences for rape were they replicated all three of the competing views of the problem identified in the court s other significant decision of the period lockett to die for her role as a reluctant getaway driver in an armed robbery ending in an apparently unplanned her case addressed the constitutionality of a statute that restricted the mitigating factors the jury could consider ohio s statute did not treat as mitigating the defendant s limited mental functioning her modest role in the robbery or the fact that the ringleader of the robbery ohio were not required in all cases of aggravated murder its statute did not violate the first two of the july cases reasons for rejecting mandatory capital sentences history and a fear of unguided nullification ohio s limitation on the mitigating factors juries could consider did however implicate the july cases third rationale that individualization is necessary to assure an especially reliable determination that the punishment particular crime and criminal a statute that prevents the sentencer in all capital cases from giving independent mitigating weight to aspects of the defendant s character and record and to circumstances of the offense proffered in mitigation creates the risk that the death penalty will be imposed in spite of factors which may call for a less severe penalty when the choice is between life and death that risk is lockett made explicit three conclusions implicit in the mandatory death penalty cases first although death is not a per se unconstitutional sentence for aggravated murder neither is it per se constitutional rather for some but not all death eligible murders death is an unconstitutionally disproportionate sentence second disproportionality depends on the extent to which all of the aggravating circumstances of the state law are neutralized by all of the mitigating circumstances in the case at some point aggravation net of mitigation is low enough that the defendant has a constitutional right to a penalty less severe than third even a high risk of disproportionate death sentencing violates the the majority s decision to limit death sentences to a small number of wart stevens view that the constitution requires states to narrow death as divisive as the majority s conclusion was its method of enforcing the conclusion was unobtrusive the court did not undertake a systematic type analysis of ohio s sentencing pattern for murder and strike down the state s statute because death sentences did not congregate near the aggravated core nor did the court strike down sandra lockett s death sentence because a type case specific the aggravating and mitigating factors located her case too far away from the aggravated core of the capital circle instead the court imposed an type procedural requirement capital sentencers must be permitted to hear and consider evidence of any aspect of a defendant s character or record and any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than this approach invalidated the ohio statute but only on the easily that it was procedurally flawed for lack of a mechanism for considering the full range of available mitigating evidence the lockett majority did not explain why it chose this form of review but whether ingeniously or accidentally the approach had a dramatic effect on the way constitutional decisions would thereafter be made in capital cases lockett turned every capital sentencing judge or jury into a determining whether the punishment of death was deserved under state criminal law with a new responsibility for determining whether the punishment of death was appropriate under federal constitutional law by assuring that death was proportionate to the amount of aggravation remaining after being discounted by available mitigation in place of the categorical type judgment the court evidently was deliberate murders the lockett majority concluded that the substantive constitutional question of the death penalty s proportionality had to be adjudicated on a type basis in each case the answer had to turn on an analysis of aggravation net of mitigation and states had to structure the penalty phase of capital trials so the verdict the jury reached embodied that type constitutional proportionality decision in each system of radically decentralized constitutional decision making via any mechanism other than type examination of penalty phase procedures would the court as in furman periodically conduct type constitutional review of the patterns of death sentences these miniconstitutional tribunals were generating to see if they conformed to the constitutional narrowing requirement or on the other hand revealed an core or still more intrusively would the court conduct its own d type constitutional review of the proportionality of particular capital verdicts the question then was whether the court would match its divisive substantive conclusions about which death sentences are constitutionally proportionate with similarly controversial modes of review taking on responsibility vigorously substantive inquiries of the categorical systematic and case specific constitutionality of death verdicts to determine the constitutional adequacy of the states specialized procedures for imposing death and to decide whether standard guilt phase constitutional protections had to be extended to the capital penalty phase the court thus suggested that the tough procedural requirements required were a prelude and aid to not a substitute for the court s own substantive review of capital outcomes and the court indeed began conducting its own substantive review in godfrey georgia the court reviewed a death sentence based
that arose either material or ideological to specific decontextualized propositions we argue that the meaning of any one issue was dependent upon its position relative to other issues in the overall sequence of questions consequently each decision changed the meaning of future issues and hence how actors understood where their commonalities of interest lay devoted to the task of rebuilding the institutions that constituted the national state delegates explicitly reshaped the board on which the understood where their commonalities of interest lay devoted to the task of rebuilding the institutions that constituted the national state delegates explicitly reshaped the board on which the political game would be played such that patterns of action within the convention had implications for patterns of action outside of the convention as each subsequent decision within the convention fixed a previous point of contention it also indirectly determined which issues would become viable conflict in the future by the end of the convention even before the first presidential election state delegations began to arrange themselves in a manner consonant with the outlines of the first party system this previously unrecognized finding only makes sense however in terms of a temporally contextualized model of political action most studies of political action examine relatively settled times actors may be in heated conflict yet the rules of how this conflict will by and large not open to question even powerful elites find their actions channeled by the structure of government organizations and by existing political divisions in some cases however the political structure that will guide future political action is created or altered through nothing other than political action itself rather than observing settled action we then have the opportunity to observe in the most extreme form we may find political actors grafting a new government structure and thereby forming a new state in this article we examine one of the most consequential moments of such concerted state formation the constitutional convention of that decided upon the basic political structure of the united states of america and attempt to explain patterns of voting by state delegations perhaps because the national level government of the united states was until the turn of the twentieth century sociologists have paid little attention to the constitutional convention as an instance of state formation historians and political scientists however have produced a substantial body of literature on the constitution most of which turns on questions of the nature of political action beginning with a heated debate over whether the constitution was the result of material interest or ideological principle and perhaps ending with a recognition that both were operating simultaneously this however overlooks the temporal dynamics of political action calvin jillson has suggested that the relative influence of material and ideological motivations was sequentially determined more specifically jillson argued different types of issues tapped into different types of motivations because debates shifted from one type of question to another it is possible to observe marked shifts in alliance structures across time this according to jillson is a reflection of a systematic oscillation between materially and ideologically motivated behaviors in light of existing accounts we do two things first we develop an alternative model of political action that can better account for the influence of second in order to demonstrate the viability of our theoretical model we argue for a methodological approach that more clearly demonstrates changes in the structure of interdelegation alignments across time it is only by virtue of the latter that we are able to empirically observe the seldom appreciated connection between state and party formation and it is only by virtue of the former that we are able to make sense of this relationship while we are sympathetic to the one explains a delegate s actions by imagining that the implications of any motion have only to do with the content of the motion and the preferences of the delegate the question then becomes which set of preferences matter and when we argue that this model is fundamentally inadequate because a consequential action in the convention was consequential not in terms of its immediate payoff but in terms of its implications for future actions fundamentally inadequate because a consequential action in the convention was consequential not in terms of its immediate payoff but in terms of its implications for future actions rather than treating all interests as fixed and linking issues to interests we find that the meaning of any one issue what it implied for alignments and oppositions between actors was conditional on how previous questions had been decided to some extent our is then fairly straightforward we provide an updated model of political action that is sensitive to temporal context and is thus better suited to interpret the types of cross time changes noted by jillson like a number of previous researchers we use formal methods to analyze the data on all votes our approach however remedies two significant methodological limitations in prior work first while narrative historians have stressed the importance of changing state time scholars using formal methods have tended to analyze all votes in the aggregate obscuring possible changes second where formal methods were used to address the issue of change over time changes in alignments were treated as the result of changes in the nature of the votes thus assuming a temporal invariance of the meaning of the issues any change in alignments between actors is a changes in the types of motions they were considering in contrast we follow changing patterns of alignment between states over time without making such assumptions more specifically we break the convention up into five periods and use multidimensional scaling to determine the logic of alignments and oppositions we find that decisions concerning the future structure of the federal government led to interpretable changes in the state delegations as some issues were settled provisional alignments over these issues fell apart thus at the very end of the convention the interest constellations within the convention were similar to those
placed on the table figure shows one example a mock up camera that is used to create a scene of interior layout simulation on the table when position and orientation of the mock up camera are recognized the system creates a vrml model of the scene and the scene appears on the wall screen computer with a cybercode tag on the augmented table then a camera mounted above the table recognize the notebook pc s id and the position on the table this recognition enables seamless information exchange between the notebook pc and the table as shown in figure the user can manipulate a cursor of the notebook pc across the boundary of computers the user can grab an object on physical objects when a notebook pc with an attached cybercode tag is recognized the system makes an ad hoc network connection between the pc and the table the table surface thereby becomes an extended workspace for the notebook pc for example a user can drag an item on the notebook pc and transfer it to the table to by moving the cursor across the boundary between can be extended into the physical space to enable these examples resolution of consumer level video cameras are not enough for cover the entire table surface we use the combination of two cameras for virtually achieving higher resolution of wider viewing area the first camera is a fixed camera that is always looking at the entire table surface this camera detects changes on the table by analyzing the difference between two consecutive video images it determines which area has been changed and sends an area changed sign to the second camera which is a computer controlled pan tilt camera that can zoom in on the changed area implementation in this section we describe the internal details of the augmented reality applications described in the previous section the cybercode recognition algorithm consists of two parts on that recognizes the id of a tag and one that determines the the cybercode tag id is recognized in the following five steps binarizing the image we are using an adaptive binarization method selecting the connected regions that have a specific second order moment these regions become candidate guide bars for the tag searching for the four corners of the marker region using the bitmap pattern in the tag using the positions of the corners of the marker the system estimates and compensates for the distortion effect caused by camera object tilting decoding the code bit pattern after checking for the error bits the system determines whether or not the image contains a correct cybercode position reconstruction algorithm the image plane it is possible to calculate a matrix representing the translation and rotation of the camera in a real world coordinate system we use the four corners of the cybercode tag as these reference points to ensure that the estimated coordinate system orthogonal the algorithm also minimizes the following constraint during estimation by using which is a vector normal to the matrix code plane we can replace with the above equation min we use the downhill simplex method to estimate the that minimizes once is calculated we can use it to recalculate vectors a point in the real world corresponds to the point where dist is the distance from the camera center to the center of the matrix code is a vector from the camera center to the center of the matrix code on the image plane and is a normalization function once the transformation matrix is known it is easy to overlay spatially correct annotation information and computer graphics on the real world video images it is also used to find a workstation class computer using two part cybercode recognition algorithm can recognize the code in real time a rate making feasible several of the composition applications described in the previous section on mobile pcs most of the processing time is devoted to simply transferring the video data to the memory and more than the half of the actual image processing time is consumed in labeling connected regions of pixels this implies that performance could be greatly improved by using a computer vision hardware a set of java classes to control cameras and cybercode recognition engine using java native method invocation mechanism these classes wrap low level image processing code and free application programmers from having to deal with the details of image processing many of the systems described in the applications section have been developed there are other possibilities than visual tagging system radio frequency tags are becoming popular and do not require line of sight detection these tags are not printable however so they cannot be used with paper documents table summarizes the features of various tagging technologies ean for product numbers and isbn for publishing thus if an application should handle a large number of existing products it would be better off using a barcode than a more exotic tagging technology for example we have developed a bulletin board system based on product barcodes this system called the thingsboard allows users to open a corresponding bulletin board of the hand held device with a barcode reader for retrieving price information from actual products a drawback of these alternatives however is that they require special reader devices in addition since these readers normally can only provide id information applications that need position information such as those illustrated in figures and should also use another sensing device cybercode movies we think this is an advantage for a tagging system using mobile devices which are subject to severe size and weight constraints some barcode readers emit a laser beam so that they can read codes that are not close to the reader this however makes difficult to use these devices in home environments visibility and social acceptance are other issues a system and a barcode makes a rather industrial impressions on users so it might not be suitable for consumer or home applications cybercode is between the two and some users recognize it as a real world icon
is not surprisingly a distinct characteristic of the coastal area as is the use of vegetable matter crushed stone in particular quartz was on the contrary used mainly in the river area at the coast this form of tempering became dominant only in the course to temper the clay wall decoration in the form of vertical lines was common at all the sites in the river area but rare at the coast a third distinguishing feature in the east is a rough outer wall created by smearing lumps of clay over it such pots with a turned down rim are related to the vorratsgefasse of the michelsberg culture in addition hazendonk assemblages in the river area comprise thin walled smooth or polished bowls and dishes of inspiration is still unclear the carinated profiles resemble those of the grimston bowls in england so the typological relations are more complex than a simple hazendonk michelsberg gradient the interregional differences show that the delfland potters had a certain independent status that allowed them to make their own technical and stylistic choices within a general earthenware differ only little from one another the rijswijk assemblage has a conspicuously low percentage of decoration whereas schipluiden stands out for the use of line decoration such differences may reflect limited contacts with the east differentiated according to site this pottery style is combined with a bipartite flint tradition in addition to a simple flake occupants used a toolkit made of flint imported from a distant source that bears a close resemblance to the toolkit of the michelsberg culture comprising triangular points spitzklinge sturdy scrapers and borers these tools were used for specific tasks in particular harvesting cereal making fire and manufacturing beads they had a special meaning for the people we also see the production of the first flint axes there do not seem to be any between the sites implying that the occupants all had access to the flint sources in the chalk zone in the south of the province of limburg hainault and pas de calais this imported flint amounted to between and a of the total amount of flint used the scores for the different sources vary quite a bit from one site to another which could mean that each local group had its own contact area though it should be added that it the different types of flint at all the sites and also at hazendonk the main types of stone used were sandstone quartz and quartzites whose sources are hard to identify the percentages of igneous and metamorphic rocks were remarkably high at schipluiden and ypenburg and differ very little from one another in the worked stone finds noteworthy finds are small nodules of pyrite which like one of the flint along the coastal cliffs of boulogne sur mer where they are still to be found today an alternative is a source in the ardennes jet and amber beads were made in delfland jet bead blanks found at schipluiden and wateringen show that the beads were produced at the sites themselves implying an innovation no such beads are known from the late mesolithic anywhere in the netherlands including hardinxveld but they are known from the swifterbant jet was relatively prominently represented at schipluiden amber at ypenburg in particular in the burials and this is an important difference between these two sites like the pyrite and one of the flint types the jet probably came from the coast near boulogne sur mer or it may have been washed up on beaches further north small pieces of amber could probably be picked up along the north sea beach to the north of delfland in several directions to obtain materials that were not to be found in their own region with the east specifically for stone with the chalk areas in the south of belgium for high quality flint and with the coast of pas de calais also for pyrite and jet on the one hand this indicates continuation of the lines of contact that had existed for more than two thousand years ever since the late mesolithic on the other the individual local hazendonk communities of delfland seem have had contacts with different areas a retrospective the above was an exercise to break the common archaeological custom of defining monolithic cultures bottom up with the sites being taken as the constituent elements by instead approaching things from the opposite direction and searching for differences between sites that resemble one another in many other respects in age and culture in landscape setting and function in order to obtain an understanding of the action of the local communities this we have been able to do thanks to the high quality of the evidence obtained in delfland the aspects that the individual sites have in common reflect the structure of the regional society while the differences between the sites show the local communities practices the choices they made to suit their needs in structural terms the community coincided with the transition from the mesolithic to the phase a period of change that covered a long time many centuries in the low countries those changes are clearly observable in many aspects of the society the individual contemporary sites which had all reached the same stage in the neolithization process however differ from one another in important social aspects the differences being quite substantial in some cases to a point the people followed their own course in the neolithization process the settlements vary from collective and site bound to mobile and open as far as subsistence is concerned one group had by this stage abandoned hunting and fishing and in the other we observe site bound preferences not so much in the basic subsistence system as in the hunting of fur bearing animals and birds and in fishing widely differing choices were made in the treatment of the dead too other social aspects show more subtle differences in particular sources of uncommon mineral raw materials an approach as adopted
techniques that are almost entirely in the latter regard the court noted that future dangerousness predictions were a prominent and explicitly approved feature of the texas statute it had upheld on its face in the july cases albeit in a case in which no expert testimony had been stephens the next two spring cases zant v stephens and barclay v florida also rejected e type capital specific constraints on aggravating factors stephens is particularly interesting because of its multiple possible meanings and transitional position between the court s expansive late decisions and the more buttoned down cases to come in stephens the georgia supreme court had ruled a statutory aggravating and it was permissible for the jury to consider the prior crimes evidence used to establish the vague factor as a nonstatutorily enumerated basis for a death sentence on certified question from the supreme court the georgia supreme court for the first time explained what was required to obtain a death sentence in georgia to justify death crimes had to cross three planes plane established by statutory aggravating factor and plane established by the jury in each case in its absolute discretion after hearing all the evidence in support of all aggravating and mitigating factors and deciding whether the evidence was sufficient to warrant georgia did not constrain the jury s plane discretion to impose although one might assume that in default of any other suggestion jurors would instinctively balance aggravation and mitigation and condemn prisoners only when aggravation was greater the georgia scheme created a risk that different juries would decide that question using the schema developed once malice murder moved a crime onto the circumference of the capital circle and a statutory aggravating factor had total discretion to impose death based on all the aggravation and mitigation absent any instructions about where within the circle the case had to be to justify a capital verdict the statute created a higher risk of death sentences outside the aggravated core than eddings and the enmund concurrence would seem to allow the risk the court was prepared to tolerate is highlighted by its rejection street reversed a conviction that because of unclear instructions a jury may have premised on conduct protected by the first amendment the court held the risk to first amendment values too great to permit the state court s affirmance of the conviction after concluding that the jury had probably found street guilty of only unpro tected conduct a retrial before a properly charged jury was required to avoid that noting how reliable woodson and lockett required to be stephens argued that the trial court s instruction to consider the invalid substantial history of assaultive behavior factor created a similarly intolerable risk that his crime was pushed across plane by the imprimatur the jury thought the statute gave to the invalid factor although acknowledging that the invalid instruction may have led the jury to give somewhat greater weight to stephens s prior criminal declining to take the type bait the court limited street to first amendment cases and accepted the georgia supreme court s view that the risk that the sentence was tainted by the invalid instruction was the court premised this conclusion on the georgia high court s assurance of specialized comparative review of sentencing patterns in factually similar offenses to avoid arbitrariness and to assure as newly interpreted by its high court in response to the supreme court s certified question ran afoul of furman itself georgia s new interpretation of its statute presented an especially difficult case under furman because of the state s unusually expansive definition of capital murder in georgia any malice murder was sufficient to cross plane in contrast virtually all other states defined first degree murder to require not only malice but also a killing in connection with a serious felony in georgia an accompanying serious felony was a statutory aggravating factor that moved the case across plane in this way georgia very nearly replicated the prevailing pre furman approach to death sentencing absolute life or death discretion upon a finding of what in most other states constituted only bare first degree felony murder the only differences between the modal statutes struck down in rgia s statute were that georgia bifurcated the guilt and sentencing trials and required the state high court to conduct comparative proportionality review on direct appeal because some of the discretionary statutes struck down in furman had likewise bifurcated the guilt and penalty the latter difference seemed to be the crucial one the supreme court rejected stephens s type challenge to procedures at the time of furman passing up a case specific explanation based on the aggravated nature of stephens s own the court focused on two features of georgia s scheme that the jury was required to find at least one valid statutory aggravating circumstance and that the state supreme court reviewed the record of every death penalty proceeding to determine whether the sentence was in the first regard the court emphasized the fundamental requirement that each statutory aggravating circumstance genuinely narrow the class of persons eligible for the death penalty and promised to invalidate allegedly aggravating behavior that is constitutionally protected irrelevant or as is noted above however stephens itself gave the narrowing requirement short shrift by permitting georgia factor that in virtually every other state was an element of death eligible murder itself in other words the court let georgia use a factor to place crimes inside the capital circle that in virtually all other states sufficed only to get the crime to the again therefore the single saving attribute of georgia s post furman statute was the obligation it gave the state supreme court to conduct back to and extended woodson s and lockett s radical de centralization of constitutional except that here state high courts not juries became surrogate constitutional decision makers this feature helps explain why justice stevens joined and wrote the decision in stephens though it validated a statute that required less narrowing than his less is better approach would
starting inverse basis basis for each new country to be tackled although a very large part of this work was completed george morton became interested in other topics and no publication ensued at the same time as working as a research assistant ailsa was also registered as a research student under george morton s supervision and worked on her phd project coke ovens both within the publicly owned british national coal board she was also becoming acquainted with but not yet having any access to electronic computers as her husband frank land was one of the early programmers with the lyons leo

the delivery problem called the laundry van problem until they discovered that the laundry van problem until they discovered that it had already been given a name the travelling salesman problem the ferranti company organized a symposium in london on lp run by dr prinz it was in connection with this conference that george morton and ailsa visited steven vajda at the admiralty and met also his assistant martin beale starting a continuing friendship and collaboration extending over many years alison doig an australian on her her travelling year became a research assistant at lse producing a bibliography of statistics with professor kendall but her master s project in melbourne had been on solving a practical paper trim problem so she was another at lse interested in lp and ilp branch and bound at the same time the bp oil company was busy developing computer lp models of refinery model and was now responsible for developing computer models in their london headquarters the team there included paula harris who later published some powerful simplex variants an obviously desirable development of refinery models was to build in to the model the shipment between crude sources refineries storage over time etc taking into account the minor complication of the discrete restrictions due to ship sizes storage tanks etc bp contracted to pay the salaries of alison doig and ailsa for salaries of alison doig and ailsa for one year to investigate this problem they soon realized that the project was beyond them unless and until one had a method of solving an lp model with discrete variables with the permission of bp they spent most of their time developing and testing what was subsequently described as branch and bb they were thinking in terms of the development of a computer algorithm but had in fact to simulate the procedure on desk calculators since they had no access to computers at that time ralph gomory had presented a very different method for solving ilp problems and dantzig published a paper on the significance of ilp in the may issue of econometrica their method appeared in the their method appeared in the following issue of econometrica cutting planes time passed alison doig became a lecturer in statistics at lse and eventually returned to australia ailsa became a lecturer at lse learned to program in fortran and to reproduce on lse s first computer an ibm the simplex drill learned on the diet problem susan powell was on one of the earliest in or at lse and then joined the transport network theory unit at lse she became a research officer and phd student and we began a collaboration in research and teaching that continues even since ailsa s retirement while branch and bound began to be built into computer codes the cutting plane approach was obviously more elegant and we spent a great deal of time experimenting with it as this effort we produced a lot of code for both bb and cutting planes which we published for use by other experimenters despite the elegance of the cutting plane approach the sad fact is that an accumulation of cutting planes on anything but a tiny problem inevitably leads to increasingly ill conditioned matrices and a failure to reach a solution it is disingenuous of balas making the comment that the literature of computational experience of cutting planes is scant to imply cutting planes is scant to imply that there was not a lot of work done in this area work was done but it was not published because as a method to solve problems branch and bound resoundingly won it is gratifying that the combination branch and cut is now often successful in dealing with real problems nato in for a nato advanced research institute we surveyed the computer codes both of the commercial code owners were willing to discuss their codes and some were even willing to run some test problems for us we found it very difficult to discover at that time anything about actual usage of the codes in

operational practice we have conducted a small survey of the published literature we have taken three single volumes of interfaces and examined any project described therein that uses ilp the volumes

nuclear families of matrilocally married daughters junior families split from the larger joint family as their age eventually daughters in the newly formed household will attract husbands and a new joint family will be produced all households whether joint or stem have their own gardens which supply all daily calories the balance is supplied by hunted gathered and fished resources less than five percent of food consumed is non locally produced two published studies deal quantitatively with the exchange of services but not resources garden labor exchange among the ye kwana in the creation of gardens land is cleared jointly by groups of men on a serial basis the tasks of weeding planting and harvesting are cooperatively performed by groups of women for men all garden labor was allocated to gardens other than their own whereas for women it was garden labor exchange was significantly correlated with household higher frequencies of exchange than distantly related households in addition closely related households had greater imbalances of exchange than distantly related households which tended to have more balanced exchange relationships another study examined all parental care of infants and toddlers and found that the amount of time a woman spent caring a child was determined by her relatedness to the child as will be demonstrated below relatedness despite its documented importance in garden labor exchange and childcare is not a significant factor in meal sharing methods quantitative studies have measured food transfers in several ways the first involves the direct observation of weighed food portions a second method pioneered by kaplan and colleagues involves the use of instantaneous scan sampling whenever a person is observed eating the researcher notes the item consumed and asks the consumer who provided the food from such records the analyst can calculate the frequency that individuals were observed consuming foods given to them by other individuals or households finally other researchers use a variety of interview protocols in which receiving households are asked to rank the frequency with which other households or individuals in a settlement transferred food resources to them the method used to document food transfers in this study is a variant of the scan on economic and other behaviors hames noted the date time and location as well as the individual s behavior in the data set used here each record was a locationally differentiated observation of a person consuming an item of food when an individual was observed eating in a household other than his or her own this instance was scored as meal sharing with these data we produced a series of matrices quantifying the number of times members of different families were observed eating in their own or in one of the seven other households in the village if three members of a particular household were observed eating in another household this was counted as three observations of meal sharing this method is identical to the one used to measure garden labor exchange among the ye kwana there hames noted the number of times an individual worked in his own household s gardens compared with other household s gardens a benefit to them at some cost to members of the host household one could argue that this is not always the case if the guest had provided the host with food however the ye kwana do not bring food to other households and they expect to be fed immediately upon arrival we know from experience that guests were occasionally fed meals based in part on resources they had previously donated to the household its food resources and independently decides whom to provide with meals in nearly all cases guests were invited for the express purpose of sharing a meal and they were not fed simply because they happened to visit this method underestimates the actual intensity of sharing because food transferred to a household and consumed only by household members is not measured table intensity of meal sharing among households frequency of shared and unshared meals by resource type statistical description of ye kwana meal sharing the data presented here come from behavioral observations on residents of the ye kwana village of toki collected in over a month period a subset of these data on meal sharing were then analyzed by mccabe the entire behavioral and locational data base on the ye kwana is available on line the database can be queried on line though an interface developed by mccabe and many of the analyses presented here can be replicated a total of behavioral observations were made on ye kwana residents of toki of these were eating observations the distribution of meal types is presented in table less than all meals consumed were of store bought foods characterization of what the individual was eating at the instant they were observed is a bit problematic when recording the data hames used a variety of rules to determine the kind of meal consumed if someone was placing or about to place food in their mouth it was easy to code the general type of food if the person was pausing or conversing during the meal then the predominant food in the s hand in his eating utensil or in a serving basket was recorded in actuality most ye kwana meals consist of a several foods and casabe as mentioned above is by far the most common denominator in all meals there are a number of different ways to describe the flow of resources or services between households they have been defined as intensity scope and balance general giving intensity measures proportion of a household s total food budget that is contributed by all other households in a sense it is a measure of subsidy from the entire settlement specific giving intensity is the amount or proportion of meals given to a household from those who do not live in the household where the eating event occurred therefore specific intensity measures how much a household gave to or
categories of smiling therefore only the felt smile as defined by ekman and friesen was considered similar to the facs is the microanalysis of nonverbal behavior completed by davis and hadiks this multistage system is designed to reveal complicated represents a dilemma within deception and detection of deception research although the thorough analysis of an individual s behavior seems to be a challenging step within the arena of deception research these methods do not seem applicable in face to face interactions when an individual wishes to assess credibility of his or her counterpart immediately these microanalyses are only possible by using sophisticated technical equipment and investing very much time a conclusion therefore they are less suitable to meeting the goal of identifying reliable deception cues to train professionals whose work depends on assessing credibility on the spot perhaps the renewed emphasis on analyzing the very content of lies with more objective methods may be more promising in the long run research consumers should be warned however to pay attention only to those studies that demonstrate that their methods can be applied route on the many stony paths to truth people as resources recruitment and reciprocity in the freedom promoting approach to property abstract theorists usually explain and evaluate property regimes either through the lens of economics or by conceptions of personhood this article argues that the two approaches are intertwined in a way that is and recognizes and protects aspects of personhood it must do both because human beings are both resources for one another and the persons whose moral importance the legal system seeks to protect this article explores how property law has addressed this paradox in the past and how it might in the future two bodies of nineteenth century law highlighted this paradox the era the law struggled over how to balance recognition of laborers bodies as resources with regard for them as legal persons these jurisprudential problems tracked contemporary debates in political and economic thought about the nature of property in human beings both the legal debates and their broader counterparts responded to the underlying problem of designating a boundary between those respects in which people are to be regarded as resources and those in which their first disputes over this boundary are disputes over both claims on resources and the moral importance of human beings this analysis illuminates the stakes of two contemporary issues voluntary peer production in digital media and the entrance of women in developing countries into the paid workforce both demonstrate how legal technological and social changes in people s status as resources interact with changes in how they do or may value one are in the direction of greater reciprocity they may help to produce a more robust conception of personhood and a more egalitarian and attractive social life introduction how should we think about the law of property the law that distributes claims on the useful beautiful and pleasurable things in the world should we try to understand how it makes us rich and ask how it could make us even richer should we explore how it makes us change those identities or should we ask how it makes us free and how it could make us even freer i take the last approach choosing that approach raises several questions which this article addresses first setting out the freedom promoting approach requires explaining its relationship to other approaches particularly the ones concentrating on property s economic advantages and its connection which property regimes can advance them second the freedom promoting approach needs a working definition of freedom a multifarious concept that is a challenge to make analytically tractable third it needs an account of what property systems do that shows how promoting freedom is not just an attractive idea in general but an apt account of the activity of these legal regimes in particular with some current debates in property reform and here i take on the challenges i have just listed i show how property regimes in some of their central operations confront the fact that people are at once bearers of personhood and economic resources for one another neither the economic nor the personhood approach takes full account of this fact which spans and confounds their respective concerns by exploring political history i develop a description of property that takes account of both features of human beings i argue that property regimes come closest to reconciling these conflicting qualities when they maximize reciprocity among persons which makes it necessary to take others personhood into account even when seeking to treat them as resources for one s own purposes i argue further that a theory of regimes two approaches to understanding property regimes have dominated legal scholarship for decades the first the economic approach understands the function of property regimes as being the allocation of resources from this point of view property rights respond to certain basic facts about the social world people need resources from air water and land to technology ideas and the things that people want to control many of these resources are scarce not in the sense of being rare but in that there is competition over them that is they are not so abundant as to be effectively nonrivalrous these facts underlie the great gains to social coordination and productivity that property rights produce these benefits are conventionally designated as gains to static and dynamic efficiency static efficiency aligns the present allocation desire backed by purchasing power clear property rights enable potential purchasers to identify the present owners of resources they believe they desire and to trade around until all resources are in the hands of those who most value them dynamic efficiency maximizes the productivity of resources over time owners are assured of being able to capture the increase in value from the improvements they make and thus into fields sand into silicon chips and words into sonnets and the description of property as the law of resources has been important
new forms of visibilities of what was previously tangible but not represented in such a manner likewise the production of indicators accounts graphs text and pictures which seek to represent a corporation s impact on the natural environment creates new visibilities as does the use of the planet as viewed from space in ecological footprinting as that movement calls for a one planet economy all of these techniques a new visibility to risks impacts or events and in doing so create new possibilities for governing the associated actors and actions one could observe that the requirement for pension providers to report on whether or not they used an ethical screen on their investments created visibility about the practice of ethical investment of itself such a requirement for data would not create a regime of practices it does however form a part of a regime of governing and does so primarily via the creation of visibilities further these forms of visibility create and imply certain knowledge sets and this constitutes the second focus of the analytics of governance knowledge both forms and informs the act of governing and dean asks what forms of thought knowledge expertise strategies means of calculation or rationality governing create certain knowledge sets about states at a point in time activities which are taking place as well as outcomes from actions again csr reporting may be used to demonstrate this point corporate nonfinancial reporting provides knowledge about aspects of organizational life to the readers of those reports institutions for knowledge creation might include organizational committees management systems information gathering protocols and a firm in a similar manner stakeholder engagement processes have the possibility of creating knowledge for stakeholders with respect to organizations rationalities and priorities at the same time knowledge of the concerns preferences and motivations of stakeholders are generated from such processes in this way knowledge is created and flows in two directions furthermore external social audits and silent accounts create new sets of from a wide variety of perspectives these knowledge mechanisms also create new visibilities of impacts in this manner visibilities and knowledge sets are interdependent as they are with the third element of the analytics of government techniques and practices techniques and practices require consideration of the technical aspects of government by asking by what means mechanisms procedures instrument tactics techniques tech constituted and rule accomplished thus for example we see csr committees within organizations and board members with special responsibility for these matters there are job descriptions which include responsibilities for certain actions outcomes likewise although csr reporting creates visibilities the documents themselves have certain technical aspects to them although these mechanisms include technical elements they cannot be reduced to technical aspects alone rather techniques also create patterns of visibility and in turn will generate particular forms of knowledge of course the generation of knowledge and how particular forms of knowledge are more powerful than is a recurrent theme for foucault as the power of science to determine environmental knowledge this may be particularly pertinent when workers or communities have their own knowledge of health impacts which may sit in contrast to expert and or official knowledge of such things identity constitutes the final element in the regimes of governing framework and forms of individual and collective identity through which governing operates and which specific practices and programmes of government try to form examples abound in this area with respect to corporate activities and social environmental factors organizations often join green business networks and clubs as a way in which to affirm their identity as a good corporate citizen and to communicate that identity to others in some instances the identity is linked to certain actions which are measured in a particular manner membership of the index the dow jones sustainability index and participation in the business in corporate responsibility would be further examples of such identities dean notes that the four dimensions of government presuppose one another however they are not reducible to one another rather each element can be identified with the relationship between these elements also being crucial he also argues that transformations may take place along each or any of these axes and transformation along one axis may entail transformation in others may be useful to illustrate these points not only are organizations and individuals and their diverse forms of behavior subject to this regime of government products can also be understood in these terms there are a myriad of certification and assurance schemes which seek to label food and other products according to some criteria labels include organic produce fair trade goods sustainably harvested fish forestry products animal welfare friendly products and made from nonexploitative child labor these various schemes feed into the creation of an ethical consumer or an environmentally responsible consumer which is evidence in individual identities as well as collective identities in addition the presence of certification logos on products provides a visibility of the assurance process so that purchasers may know which products should be sitting behind the logos are extensive sets of technical practices which inter alia define what constitutes organic food detailed rules of when a farm can be certified organic and inspection processes to check that food reaches the specified standard with these technical aspects of government underlying consumer confidence in the credibility of the certification brand thus it mutually dependent and interlocking sets of characteristics around an area of government the goals of governance the final element of dean s notion of governmentality is that such activities have a strangely utopian element government is not only necessary but possible in the context of this paper governance which focuses on regulation of environmental such risks can be identified and controlled one underlying suggestion is that if processes of social learning based on new ways of working and new forms of technological know how could be encouraged then it would be possible to have more sustainable forms of development the world which would be
to be virtually ubiquitous within the consumer credit industry yet analysts of credit scoring present this not as a straightforward unhindered rational adoption by lenders on the contrary it is put forward as a narrative of the persuasive triumph of the unquestionable efficiency of risk presented as a straightforward quantitative superiority for example its discriminatory potential is estimated to be per cent better thus increasing the number of profitable customers accepted and decreasing the number of costly defaulters yet it is not only in elevated revenues and dampened costs that the use of risk is adjudged to prove its worth but in the wider efficiencies that it imparts to the lender s credit scoring is deemed transparent consistent uniform unbiased less labor intensive and automatable in addition it is time saving thus lowering the attrition levels of lost customers experienced while also providing a close calculable management control over lending policy yet scoring had not only to face the problem of effectively constituting individuals as risks it also had to gain the acceptance of the credit community in this account of the mercurial outsider statistical and operations research experts battled the regressive conservatism of lender managements historically wedded to judgmental decision making as the traditional means of sanctioning credit to convince them of the progressive for instance on the website of score modeller fair isaac noting milestones in the company s history one of the early events recorded in was when the company sends letter to the biggest american credit grantors asking for the opportunity to explain a new concept credit scoring only one replies yet that one reply from american investment corporation provided the humble of credit scoring but while a discourse of risk may have eventually triumphed over this managerial rear guardism to become the pre eminent means of conceptualizing consumers in relation to default the technologies through which risk itself is constituted are seen by experts to be subject to a permanent process of failure contestation and regeneration and the rivalrous claims of competing operational basis upon which scoring models are built and deployed is subject to a permanent reflexive analysis that seeks not to dissolve the framework of statistical scoring methods but on the contrary to improve their potential discriminatory power in practice by rendering more accurately the predictive risk determinations of particular cases of default that they attempt to formulate however failure is endemic to the government of assumption is one of indeterminism and irreducible stochasticity although certain regularities can be seen within the population the future actions of any one individual are not only not known but are inherently unknowable the effectiveness of a credit scoring model can thus be judged only macroscopically on how well it distinguishes at the level of the population of good and bad consumers yet a credit scoring model s efficacy at distinguishing these sub populations is seen itself to be subject to numerous risks which interfere in its effective constitution of default risk first methodological risks attach to specific techniques used in the particularly prone to analytical difficulties if the sample size is insufficient second procedural risks attach to the specific construction of a model most critical here also is seen to be the problem of sample bias a large creditor deploying a scoring model across a large cannot take into account regional economic characteristics and thus evident regional subpopulation differences therefore while the model may be predictive overall it records relatively inaccurate risk scores that is an inappropriate ranking for individuals between regions third temporal risks pose a threat to the integrity of a scoring model s risk of population drift the correlations calculated between variables used to make risk predictions are fixed within the model but change and alter over time in the real world of the population all these risks methodological in terms of the statistical technique to be a formulated credit scoring model to distinguish groups of good and bad borrowers deplete the accuracy of the risk assessment made at an individual level and degrade the efficiency of the lender at producing profit at any given threshold more costly defaulters will be accepted and more profitable consumers will be refused credit in response the experts who elucidate these risks simultaneously offer means for obviating them by formulating new accuracy establishing benchmarks for deriving representative samples detailing how multiple scorecards can be deployed to account for regional and population variations suggesting reject inference techniques to estimate the probabilistic fates of historically rejected consumers and advocating the implementation in association with lenders of practices of periodic model validation and revision therefore within credit is thus never taken for granted but must be constantly evaluated maintained and recreated in order to preserve the integrity and reliability of such constitution however in terms of the constitution of risk not only have statistical models been problematized but they have been challenged by alternative epistemologies that have found some application with the domain of consumer credit including decision tree and neural network systems nevertheless these competing alternatives do not engender a fundamental challenge to the discourse of risk around which the sanctioning systems of creditors are built in fact as gruenstein suggests any credit risk evaluation system is implicitly a statistical one each technology in practice seeks to know better the risk adhering to an individual applicant within the context of a population overall incidence of default endured by the creditor in essence the use of any one of these diverse techniques is assembled around the same ontological conception of what risk means although they differ by offering alternative avenues for knowing that risk they share a common objective which is to render it more accurately as an objectivized quality of the individual each too is concerned with the calculable effects of default not causes in every case default is as an inherent aspect of the group and individuals are persistently conceived as agglomerations of attributes that are historically probabilistically associated with a repayment outcome like more conventional statistical techniques
property would help him on his path to riches desirous to have a breed of negroes maverick compelled his male slave to have sex with the female will d she nill d she whether she wanted to or not and the story is clear maverick knew she did not want to he gave the orders to the slave man only after first seeing she would not yield by persuasions clearly he felt no shame about a woman to submit to rape since he himself told the story to josselyn a man he knew to be writing a report of his trip anyway even if she protested she was his property property that if forced to breed could make him money consider samuel maverick writing to john winthrop only two years after the rape concerned that a white female servant of his had acted inappropriately one ralfe greene and jonathan peirse each challinginge a promise of mariage from a maide servant left with me by mr babb beinge daughter unto a friend of his either of them desired my consent within a weeke one of the other but hearinge of the difference i gave consent to neither of them desiringe there might be an agreement first amongst themselves or by order from your worship the maide hath long tyme denied any promise made to was ever any contract made betwene them yett i once herd her say shee would have the said greene and desired my consent thereunto but it rather seems shee first promised peirse and still resolves to have him for her husband for the better clearinge of it i have sent all such of my peopell as can say any thinge to the premises and leave it to your wise determination conceivinge they all deserue a checke for theire manner of proceedinge i take leave and rest commaund samuel mavericke this is a different samuel maverick concerned about the propriety of a servant s engagement reluctant to let her commit to either man without a clearing of the matter such attention to details such obedience to custom did race make the difference in his consideration of sexual mores of course it did if ever there was a reminder of the inextricable linkage of gender and race here it is the seeming illogic of his varying degrees rational when maverick s ideological assumptions replace our his wife must have shared those beliefs responsible like most new england women for all domestic concerns it seems likely that mrs maverick would have had more contact than her husband with the slaves in their household had she ordered that the woman be raped had she suggested it did she know is it fair of me to wonder if she felt any sisterly bond with the woman under her roof her own quick second marriage suggests she may have seen relationships in practical terms on a frontier after all relatively few have time for romance that pragmatism may have expanded to include her slaves she must have understood her own marriage and her own status in the world at least partly in contrast to the position held by her slave women amias maverick could not be ordered to have sex with a man she was something different and so were her daughters and everyone on the island knew it thus is a social construction made real that reality was ugly imagine the first time the man came to perswade the woman to have sex with him perhaps he came under duress maverick after all held both their lives in his hands did the enslaved man understand his own safety to be contingent on his agreeing to harm the woman did they even speak the same language we know from josselyn s account that the woman refused even as she may have known that refusal was man suffered too having watched slavers abuse women in the same ways she had witnessed and experienced the slave man now found himself obligated perhaps against his conscience to use his own body to enact the same violence on an acquaintance resistance would have been pointless even had he run away maverick could have bought another slave to breed with the woman an impossible situation but maybe the man needed no threats and deserves no sympathy slavery could make impotent powerless if not literally certainly socially perhaps the man saw as irresistible the opportunity to reassert his masculinity no matter how low his race placed him in new england s power structure the woman s gender placed her a step lower still impregnating her may have seemed an excellent way to reassert the sense of self worth and autonomy his environment consistently denied him or maybe he was simply a violent man sold out of the west indies for the very made him willing to rape at his owner s request or maybe just maybe he thought making a child was resistance itself a thumb in the eye of a system determined to use africans until they died those questions can never be answered but even certainty about the man s motives would not change the outcome the woman was raped and she knew it was coming josselyn tells us that she had had her by force an extra form of torture the psychological before the physical enacting the future attack from memory in her mind before living it in reality even if she had been lucky enough to escape the experience herself she had undoubtedly seen and heard rapes of other women she knew what to expect in graphic detail alone scared isolated by race culture even language from those around her she had to wait the attack itself remains shadowy no amount of uncover that encounter i can only ask uncomfortable questions verging on prurience wondering how to reflect on the details of a rape without becoming what saidya hartman has cautioned us against a voyeur of pain and terror speaking of nineteenth century
pieces were substantially revised bruce wood in his edition of the ode for the purcell society did indeed identify some likely pindaric improvements places where the violin parts rise suspiciously high in comparison purcell s normal some bars of eccentric writing for second trumpet in the final a spurious bass line at the beginning of the day that such a blessing inconsistencies in repeats in the final problems with some individual notes and and of course the obviously eighteenth century figuring however he did not consider the possibility that might have added some of the instrumental parts himself and reworked aspects of the structure of some proof that pindar had tampered with the ode was provided in a recent article published by clare brown and peter holman in early music performer where they drew attention to a set of plates entitled fac similes of celebrated composers printed in concert room and orchestra anecdotes in by thomas busby a the plates seem to be lithographic reproductions of tracings from composers and include a short passage taken from come ye sons of art apparently copied from an autograph that is now lost both text and music hands are certainly convincing this brief extract is significant for a number of reasons not least because it raises the possibility that the source from which the plate was made may still survive most of purcell s autograph odes of the probably destroyed in the whitehall fire and the fact that at least part of this ode still existed in the early nineteenth century gives very real cause for hope unfortunately there is little evidence of what happened to the manuscript after brown and holman demonstrate that it probably belonged to the composer and antiquarian collector william shield at the time of busby s publication since most of the other extracts shield including two sources that still shield apparently left his library to his wife anne stokes shield at his death in and it is possible that the disposal of one of the extant manuscripts at a puttick and simpson auction on may resulted from her however as brown and holman note the catalogue for this sale does not suggest that it included other shield manuscripts and i have been unable to find evidence of a sale of shield s other surviving auction catalogues of the in any case shield seems to have given away many of his music manuscripts well before his death several were presented to vincent novello for example including the source for the extract from haydn s setting of dainty pl facsimile reproduced in thomas busby s concert room and orchestra anecdotes apparently traced from purcell s lost autograph of come ye sons of art reproduced by permission university of leeds davie in busby s facsimiles which is now in a private for the time being at least it seems that the trail begins and ends with shield despite the absence of the autograph itself busby s facsimile still provides one substantial clue about pindar s arrangement of the ode in lcm the extract shows the end of the the vocal entry is given for two undesignated instruments in clefs and one in clef in pindar s version however this introduction is copied on six staves for two oboes two violins viola and continuo and the section corresponding with the facsimile includes all these instruments busby s short fragment therefore provides conclusive proof that pindar did alter the instrumentation of come ye sons of art and sets us on the path to retrieving a version of the ode closer to the music purcell actually wrote to find further evidence of pindar s likely approach to come ye sons of art we need to look closely at the reworkings he made to the odes for which we do have authoritative sources pindar s arrangements the countertenor solo come ye sons of art lcm used by kind permission of the royal college of music these ceremonial pieces necessarily pindar s approach to each is slightly different as with the majority of purcell s early odes welcome to all the pleasures is written on a small scale and is scored for strings only whereas of old when heroes is purcell s first ode to use full baroque including two trumpets two oboes and two recorders as as the usual strings and continuo hail bright cecilia is his longest and most magnificent ode adding timpani to the scoring of the yorkshire feast clearly issues of scale are significant both in terms of the number of added instrumental parts and the overall length of the arrangements pindar expands welcome to all the pleasures through extra repetition and the fusion of solo or ensemble movements with their associated ritornelli but there are no such alterations made the two later odes despite these distinctions pindar s basic approach to reworking the odes relies on a relatively small number of techniques common to all three works which enable us to make judgements about his likely treatment of come ye sons of art his alterations fall into five main categories replacement of entire movements end of act iii of the indian from which he omits the trumpet part meaning that its missing independent entries in the canzona leave notable gaps in the texture there are two more significant observations to make about the substitution of this movement however first it was not because pindar s source lacked the original symphony that he replaced it the movement is repeated halfway through the yorkshire feast song and at this point in lcm pindar writes out the entire symphony from the ode virtually unaltered in relation to purcell s autograph second pindar obviously had access to a copy of at least some sections of the indian queen while he was copying lcm a fact that could be of some importance when we come to analyze the opening instrumental material for come ye sons of art scoring changes his additions affect choruses or instrumental sections
