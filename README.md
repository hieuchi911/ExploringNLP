# ExploringNLP
This is just a set of algorithms related to NLP that I build myself to gain thorough understanding of NLP
What I've done so far:
  N-grams based random sentence generator: This algorithm generates random sentences based on bigram.
  Naive Bayes classifier: This algorithm does binary classification (positive - negative) given a set of film reviews
